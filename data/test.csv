the employee preparing food this friday night was amazing .
the food was cooked slow when there was no one else in the restaurant .
from the first encounter to the last it was all bad .
everything was delicious .
the hummus is the best !
we all enjoyed our time there .
it was edible but not delicious .
this is an excellent restaurant .
we were a perfect match made for the streets of new york !
do not spend money here they are evil !
this was not explained to me when i signed my contract for the system .
worst car wash ever .
"he insisted , `` that 's how you get it to go . ''"
"tonight , christmas eve , i decided to give them another go ."
great staff that really appreciates and takes care of the regulars !
_num_ strikes .
that 's one of the great things about this place .
spouse had a burger which was great as well .
vegas roll is amazing !
sir benedict omelet was delicious .
we love this doctors integrity and honesty !
had a great time .
first off there were _num_ customers in the building for dinner .
so did not get my soup or salad .
i had the oreo flavor and it was awful as well .
"_num_ minutes later , our food was delivered ."
just stopped in for an ice cream cone with my friend !
he refused to give them to me .
these mechanics are terrific .
too expensive for what you get .
"they did n't even get the horchata right , too sweet ."
so we went back in to the counter and found our server .
"the beers are priced right , especially during football season ."
the painting of downtown madison in the rain is fantastic .
linda at front desk is funny and very welcoming .
"every time i come here , my order gets messed up ."
"very helpful , got our group all set up and looking sharp !"
"friendly staff , great service , and they take great care of our dog ."
have to say ross j is top _num_ in town in my opinion .
la fonda is absolutely tasty !
_num_ minutes later i finally got my order .
i sat at the sushi bar and waited _num_ minutes before anyone acknowledged me .
we showed up at _num_ on saturday and the place looked dead .
the waitresses are all so cute and so nice .
i just had marilyn touch up my lips .
"it takes about _num_ min to arrive , but well worth it ."
"even though it 's busy , the service is still timely and friendly ."
i enjoy going to this restaurant often .
the accommodations were excellent .
the las vegas monorail was perfect for my recent trip to vegas .
"if anyone asks me about where they should go , i always recommend aloha !"
my boyfriend and i each got the soul food platter .
pumpkin pancakes had too much cinnamon .
this place is awesome !
the rate quoted on the phone did not include $ _num_ fee .
it 's no wonder why people drive to vegas from phoenix .
"it was excellent , high quality and reasonably priced ."
"i recommend this place , it has a homey feeling once you are inside ."
i wish i could give a negative review .
delicious no lettuce salads - except they need to chop their cucumbers smaller .
"when the food came out , it was not corrected ."
the waitress took our empty basket and did n't come back with more .
"their prices are outstanding , and the service is awesome !"
"loved the food , especially the mashed potatoes and clam chowder ."
they also have a full bar !
the food and the service were genuine .
"it was a disaster , a horrible experience ."
so is it worth a _num_ mile drive on a regular basis ?
angie is the best by far .
mostly a harley place or prepare to get an insult .
"the food is amazing , fresh ingredients , homemade , special touches ."
they do n't have happy hour because it 's always happy hour here .
owner was extremely polite .
very clean and recently updated .
my latest experience : it was horrible .
their draft menu is pretty decent and they usually run a bunch of specials .
i would highly recommend using a different company for your garage door needs .
the hot salsa is his favorite and he asks for the larger one .
which i felt was way over priced .
then the owner came over to finish my pedicure .
delivery is always fast and they have coupons regularly in the paper .
their posted business hours are until _num_ pm at night .
she refused to give us her name and kept hanging up on us .
"when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed ."
the guy counted the boxes right but put _num_ on my bill .
the sales guy went down to get everything and i waited an hour .
"within _num_ hours , i had three major chips ."
lunch buffet is very good .
it is truly `` the perfect bar '' .
service was great and the prices were affordable .
hand cut fries were good also .
"the bbq pork was yummy , but that is where our satisfaction ended ."
this is good new york style pizza .
"also , the food was a big disappointment ."
we found an amazing ring and i could n't be happier .
which is a big plus .
"they took a ct scan but we never received results , still have n't ."
customer service and communication was horrible .
it 's my go-to brunch spot .
she told me that i need to have my freezer checked out .
was told _num_ to _num_ min .
but the experience was not worth $ _num_ !
easily one of our favorite spots and the owners are wonderful !
thank for the great experience !
customer service at this store is not their highest priority .
this place is horrible !
you can taste the love in every item that they make .
you can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in great hands .
"i knew she was quirky , but that was rude and weird ."
"it 's a _num_ min drive for us , but well worth the effort ."
bacon wrapped shrimp and stuffed shrimp .
can not stay away from kabob grill this food is so delicious .
the job was perfect and i was able to leave town as planned .
this place is missing one key ingredient : flavor .
i 'm a fan of deli 's and jason 's hits the spot .
"three rounds feed _num_ , so it is close enough ."
staff is great .
they have fast service and a great atmosphere if you feel like dinning in .
i did n't really like it .

this restaurant has gone downhill fast .
tony was honest and competitive with his pricing .
first day we stayed here they shut down pool for dust storm .
they did not tell me this when i called .
the waiters and waitresses are fantastic !
i ca n't really say i am surprised by my disappointment with this store .
it took too long to park even !
loved it !
"we were in and out in _num_ minutes , with gift wrapping ."
not only did i waste my time but wasted gas driving there for nothing !
and the food is pretty dang good too .
so my friend sent the burrito back and opted not to get anything else .
we had fun visiting .
i was very happy with my short stay here .
another night 's stay at hooters and it got worse .
"gary is fast , friendly , and super knowledgable about cars ."
my daughter and i shared the chef 's special pizza .
i bought a sectional sofa on july 3rd and paid for the delivery .
every single thing we had was delicious and seemed very fresh .
tasted like it had been sitting for awhile .
the customer service sucks even more than the selection .
price is fair i suppose for below average food .
i love places that serve breakfast all day !
thank you to carlos for installing my battery !
it is not a _num_ star burger place but it is a solid _num_ .

as usual the food was excellent .
it 's definitely one of our favorites in the entire city !
dr moore is friendly and casual .
it seemed very chaotic and no organization .
my wife and nephew had children parm that they enjoyed .
they even have happy hour specials and apparently do free tastings once a week .
"for me , it was a cheap chinese remote control helicopter ."
he 's caring and professional and still manages to always be on-time .
"so here 's the thing , i 've been coming here for years ."
also they are always nice here and make me want to come back .
i 'm glad i found this place .
even the service was only fair .
even the pool was a disappointment .
"the food was just standard thai food , nothing spectacular ."
for starters he refuse to refill a prescription for my son .
my second ride was awful .
do n't move here this place is horrible !

the girl behind the counter was not friendly at all .
the food and service does n't warm anything .

the place is packed for brunch hour on weekends .
cheap but that 's it .
my kids have been going to this school for years and it is excellent .
why would i pay for wheels to get cleaned and they 're not ?
the server was pretty poor .
"asked for chorizo with fried eggs , but got it all scrambled ."
they provide great food and have a great service staff .

the environment was very sketchy and unsafe .
we came back the next day because of how much we liked it .

there is a reason they are off the strip and nobody goes there .
first bite ... the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour .

i 'd been here about three years ago ... maybe under different management .
the chopped salad was delish and it made me feel good about ordering it .

this is always our go-to ice cream place .
went there today and was treated like garbage .
but all in all they were n't awful .
they only came and addressed one or two things after i filed the papers .
a bad choice for a motel in phoenix if your plans include sleep .
every aspect of our experience was top notch .

the fact that this salon is right by my house is even better .
"the food was good , fresh and hot ."

mac and cheese is flavorful !
i love this vs the best of all of them .

when i called the lady answering barely understood what i was asking for .
she just looked through the lost & found list without putting me on hold .
good finds .
the service was excellent and they even had a magician to entertain the guests .
once i basically ran into one he was helpful .
these are some quality donuts !
somehow that was still not enough to get my money back .

the worst part of the resort for me was the front desk .

"good prices , but the service and food usually suck ."
"the food was decent , and we got an unlimited supply of naan bread ."
the service was very good and the people were friendly !
to say i was disappointed would be putting it mildly .

the food was bad and the service was bad .
the facility itself looks like it was built _num_ years ago and never renovated .

and both my husband and i liked the food a lot .
their gear is actually pretty good as well .
the staff are very kind !
not a terrible experience but the whole pint thing killed it for me .
the crab cake benedict was excellent .
she began to sigh and just look very annoyed .
this is definitely an airport i want to come back to on future trips .

"that aside , they do really good work and are trustworthy ."
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .
breakfast was delicious and so was the coffee .
this place rocks and is good for kids and adults alike .
i love seafood but refuse to eat it when the establishment cleanliness is questionable .
"contemporary , sophisticated vibe in upscale room makes me want to return ."
needless to say i was upset .
holy cow it 's good .
best night to go in my opinion is monday and thursday .
best of all i tried around this area .
this is a good chinese place !
ned 's is a great local sandwich shop .
have been many times and always a good experience .

the food was great and service was very helpful !
this is one of the best places i have eaten in las vegas .

"only _num_ car ahead of mine , and i was promised _num_ minutes ."
husband enjoyed the meatball sub too .
"i mean , is this thing on ?"
they are so nice and knowledgeable .

not to mention the place was filthy !
"meh , i 've had better ."
"everyone was nice , the food was amazing ."

the green corn tamales were actually decent but pass on the wet burrito .

the chicken fettuccine alfredo is amazing .
i looked in the back and saw the expiration date was _num_ april _num_ !
needless to say we skipped dessert ... .

the staff is friendly and give wonderful service .
we wo n't recommend our foster friends return here either .
i shared a size regular with my boyfriend .
"it was light , flavorful , and satisfying ."
worst of all was the haircut itself .
it saved us from going to several stores that day .
i 'm hooked .
the overall atmosphere is great .
staff are becoming noticeably younger and with that noticeably less helpful .
ok this place is just plain nasty .
i personally had a great experience .
thank you so much box brothers !
i 've had the worst experience ever with this airline .
for the quality of the food the price was way too high .

allison was a great server .
maintenance and service are superb .
it 's is scary how quiet this opener is !
carpet came out great and even got rid of some old stains .
large room space just laid out terribly .
growing up my mother was a nail technician .
"they were open late , compassionate , patient , and reasonably priced ."
i recommend for take out .
when entering you get very cramped up when it 's busy .
we were pleasantly surprised .
she did not offer me coffee or anything else .
it closes too early and opens too late .
had an incident with someone coming in our room @ _num_ in the morning .
"unfortunately , it 's not my first time throwing away coffee from here ."
both times i had friendly and knowledgeable service .
i do not recommend this business .
"so , they 're trying to make it up to me ."
our server was nowhere in sight .
their close proximity does n't win out over quality .
i really thought they were much better than this .
the ranch dressing was watery .
i am _num_ years believe me this .
they never even gave me a menu when i asked for one .
unfortunately that was not the case .

great little place when you need to grab something quick .
"food is very good , so far everything we ever ate was delicious ."

the employees are considerate and do a good job .
"cashier apologized , asked me if i wanted sauce and offered free chocolate pastry ."
we went to the buffet there and the food was good .
"so , i bought a membership because i saw they other perks ."
"however , we had a good experience ."
even the rolls were almost stale .

the cheese is cold though '' .
the bonus is that they have wise potato chips and cannoli .

"the staff is friendly , knowledgable and involved with the community ."
the re fried beans were overcooked and were simply bad .
i literally have no reason to ever return to this place again .
my lady friend loves the breakfast and other meats .
i give the review _num_ star because that is the lowest option available .
i trust them with my car and you should too .
he was very nice and gentle person with a lot of patience .
i refused .
"the place is huge , and always crowded ."
apparently cutting other people off on a single lane road is your priority .
oh the rice was mushy .
it was filling and the bartender was entertaining .
"my wife enjoyed the chicken burrito , but my combo fajitas was really flavorless ."
i came here wanting some kalua pig .
"but the more i thought about the experience , the more irritated i became ."
this was by far the worst experience ive ever had .
the food was n't bad or good .
that was the only good thing about this place .

it is great they also hire local kids to work there .
shes very helpful with the menu and giving us her opinion .
pricey unless you go during happy hour .
it did n't look like they had cleaned between lunch and dinner .
scheduling was wonderful !
the office is a nightmare situation .

everything is amazing !
"to top it off , our waitress was really ... unusual ."

i found hiro sushi to be excellent .
he was so friendly to every single person he encountered .
i 've always been happy with everything i 've ordered here .
the room was absolutely disgusting .
reverse happy hour from _num_ pm to close is the best !
so customer service and support are important .
mark provided excellent and professional service for our personal taxes .
"but it was so cold , it was breaking apart ."
i did n't even get an apology for the wait .
a different ( older lady ) cashier looked at me like i was crazy .
then it got worse everytime i came there .
my family loves it .
we felt that entire staff at this particular hyundai location was exceptional .
my experience with buying a new car was rough at first .
pay for it only to notice _num_ minutes later it 's the wrong thing .
it smells wonderful and everything is delicious .
they did a great job - better than i would have done .
we got thin crust and is was crusty and dry .
"that being said , rico the internet sales manager was fabulous to work with ."
first course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto .
"but it 's not old , either ."
it has great sushi !
it must have been a survey because she never came back .
rubio 's is my favorite fast food restaurant chain .
i 'm headed there today because my `` service brakes '' light came on .
basically the margaritas are trash .
dont bother calling their medical assistance phone line because no one will reply .
i went to the service desk and the woman at the counter was horrible .
pretty much there is n't gon na be a next time .
how do you review a national chain like this ?
is cheap .
we stayed here three nights while attending a three game series at chase field .
food was terrific .

it is going to be a while but it 's worth the wait .
this place is a gem !
"now when you gain _num_ pounds , do n't blame me ."
service was great like always .
"the room was small , which was fine until we saw the bedroom ."
i just had a horrible experience at this place .
"it was not worth $ _num_ , the variety of food was real limited ."
its a little hole in the wall but it is good !
my sister and i went here and it was great .
the stuff that they have hanging on the wall for decoration is run down .
i have n't eaten anything all day .
the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and genuinely care about you and your pets .
one is super thin and i 'm literally embarrassed .
he commented that we could have made much better tacos at home .
i threw this pizza out the next day .
i always get an extra spring roll because it 's delicious .
the cons : disclosure - i do not care for vegas .
imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .
the food is delish and the ambiance is romantic .

"i especially like it in the back , it 's nice and private ."

room was horrible .
not to mention they are _num_ weeks out to do the work .
the miso soup was excellent .
all hard bread and dried out meat .
"our server was n't the least bit friendly , attentive or accommodating ."
the people in here are just stupid !
"it 's okay , i guess ."
"she was very patient , friendly and knowledgable ."
"if you want a friendly dentist , this is not the place for you ."
loved it !
life is too short to waste you time and money on this place !
and of course the beer was good and very well priced .
turns out she gave me one less quesadilla then we asked for .
food came quickly and was great .
the lack service killed this place for me .
the worker who worked at the steak station in the buffet was so bad .
did n't have chips when we asked the waitress .
my girlfriend and i both used groupon 's for the massage .
cottage cafe is a classic breakfast joint .
the chips were so-so but the salsa was very good .
"this rating is only for the irritating link , not the food ."
it 's a little piece of authentic retro wisconsin .
"it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected ."
i was pretty disappointed with this restaurant .
i enjoyed the food and atmosphere from the first time i visited .
i this walgreens a lot !
i lost the screw in my glasses .
"since writing my last review , this location has improved tremendously ."

"and say hello to ruth , the ever present waitress who knows everyone !"
they collect your estimated co payment but refuse to refund the difference .
"wow , but mccarran is a weird airport ."
service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink !
went for sunday brunch and was very disappointed .

"then , insult to injury , our wings were short !"
there were hardly people there and it was n't fun at all .
"the garlic bread was really good , we loved it ."
i was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews .
even their milk tea is fantastic !
you are getting the worst possible customer service then .
"we talked to the manager , just `` sorry '' `` sorry '' ."
his light went off and said he was n't standing and left .
"got through security pretty quick , that was nice ."
even as i spoke to the manager he was n't of any help .
while the other half was pretty much mediocre .
no apology from anyone and still had to pay for my food .
so my boyfriend sat out in the car and waited .
the ladies in the office are absolutely the best .
i told the girl no sauce and beef not pork .
i absolutely love this place !
multiple things went wrong .
"i do n't even like eating meat , and i will crave this dish !"
luckily i had his wallet though .
oh yeah the teriyaki bowl was good as well .
this page is definitely worth a try .
the bar is impressive ask bruce to mix you a drink !
"even after the second surgery , i am still not happy ."
she said she did n't have either .
weekend stays are rather more expensive .
my family and i have been going here for years they do awesome work !
that is the absolute worst part of the whole ordeal for me .
the hop knot is my favorite beer .
i was craving dairy queen for quite awhile .
and the cashier lady forced me into buying a large drink .
i 'd recommend it if you 're in the neighborhood .
i love that they always have new items as well !
"the store is always clean , the staff is fast but friendly ."
they really know how to treat a guest .

"he is extremely professional , very thorough , and very compassionate ."
"best italian food i 've ever had , hands down ."
"service was great and our server was a delight , will definitely be back ."
i dunno .
"unfortunately , the service was really slow ."
it is scary and drug dealers live there .
the area is huge inside .
"the meat was juicy , slightly spicy and the chimi was fried just right ."
they gave me a really hard time and made the process pretty scary .
the men are great looking and the party upstairs is insane .
i just find it generic .
"as for the food , it was bland , not much flavor ."
great customer service and the happy hour price is great.
it felt and did look clean .
this is a great place to bring coworkers after a long night of work .
food is good .
the order was ready when i arrived and the owner was pleasant and sincere .
the delivery is very good .
she quoted me a price before the work began .
poor service where people do n't seem to enjoy their work .
everything was excellent as usual .
the guy talked to us for _num_ minutes and tried to help us .

this place does get busy so its best to call the order in .
"steak was very , very good ."
for starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip .

"this time , i called and got an appointment _num_ weeks in advance ."
my boyfriend and i went here for our year and a half anniversary .
"the service was excellent , as was the food ."
they have fabulous service in all aspects .
not a place to go if you like wraps .
"full of yummy , crispy veggies ."
the manager was apologetic and said she would look into it .
it rocked !
the student discount is wonderful too .
everything i 've tried and everything my friends have tried has been delicious .
i really do not see me going back anytime soon .
it 's not .
the people there really take care of you !
i ordered my meal with no mayo .
this place is always clean and organized .
also the price was very fair !
we go in the early evenings and it 's full .

everything was great and i will return !
"it 's light , yet you wont leave hungry ."
i love the online check in .
"if i was the gm of the establishment , well i would be embarrassed !"

beef taco was ok.
"_num_ shirts , _num_ pants at tower cleaners cost me $ _num_ ."

"at that moment , i ended the cut ( should have ended earlier ) ."
it 's a place that is worth trying .
i felt like i was doing something wrong each time i went back .
for food that was not as good as mcdonalds .
we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .

i tried shopping here and i have to say i was extremely disappointed .
delighted whenever we pick up our clothes .
by this time i had no more trust in them .
it also cost more than it should .
the crowd is always a great mix of people .
our waitress did finally return to apologize for forgetting my plate .
"there were dozens , all in the $ _num_ price range ."
the way they handle parties of _num_ or more is ridiculous .
this little gem is in the heart of noda .

this place is perfection .
it was simply ok in my book although a little run down and old .
i love their produce .
there is no care or compassion given to the pets at all !
all worth a try if you have the appetite .
i was disgusted and offended .
needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .
she said they could charge me for a new burrito .
i started going to los olivos after i started working in downtown phoenix .
the guide was knowledgeable and did a good job keeping the group engaged .
again i mentioned i wanted to do this as cheap as possible .
the menu is simply simple italian .
everything on there menu that i 've tried is awesome !

orange chicken : chicken undercooked .
the absolutely worst experience i have ever had with a doctor !
there were only about _num_ tables sat when we got there .
my fiance really likes their blooming onion .
service was awful too .
bonus : they sell fresh homemade tortillas there .
so now they assume everyone does n't know chinese and uses forks ?
it 's worth the wait ( and weight ) -- it so delicious !
the staff most times are just rude .
this is a great place to eat !
the bed was comfortable enough and everything was clean .
"they were quick , easy to deal with , reliable , and cost effective ."

i chose the `` smothered fries '' which had bacon and cheese on them .

the staff went out of their way to show him a good time .
the entire staff in that office is extremely friendly and welcoming !
there are really great food choices and excellent service .

this is my new favorite hotel/casino on the strip .
the quality of the food was def good as well !
it was a horrible experience .
"i went here for a simple oil change , and it was a disaster ."
the food quality is bad now .

they do not always do the full top off service !
i think the class is soo long to schedule in dawn 's day dreaming .
the meat is really good too .
the weekend buffet is the best around .
the baklava and cheesecake were ok.
so i am assuming they do n't make them in house .
they did n't even offer to make the correct order for me .
"the crust is crispy , the sauce is flavorful and the veggies are fresh ."
i 'm appalled at the service or lack there of .
went on a friday at noon .

they have many other excellent choices .
but i highly recommend if you love pizza to come to broadway 's pizzeria .
i love this place !
"the atmosphere was great , our server was very pleasant and attentive ."
they certainly do n't deserve the business .

instead it was a full _num_ minutes later than she said .
took my family from ohio here and we had a great experience !
i think i might even chosen olive garden 's pasta dishes over theirs .
"2am after the bar , it 's being cleaned ."
they have strong sense of responsibility as well .
"wait , ceasar salad was ok !"
the miso soup is delicous !
studio _num_ is the best !
"fish is so fresh , and portion are large , just a great value ."
service was excellent and we were treated very well .
no one is there .
sketchy and lazy people work here !
i have never met such a pushy sales person in my life .
i love this store !
this is my new spot .
"the performance was fantastic and very talented , the costumes where amazing and beautiful ."
the service is beyond excellent .
had a two hour layover here and i was very pleased with the airport .
best sushi i 've ever had !
this is a terrible place to try to take a large group .
everyone at this location is great .
i walked out and called corporate which also was not very much help .
she rudely said we would have to pay almost _num_ for the buffet .
"friendly people , great food , large portions make for fine lunchtime eats ."
the staff did n't seem to `` get '' dogs .
"the owner commented , `` too much ?"
hopefully when things calm down at work we can purchase another package .
the wifi is horrible !
bloody mary was $ _num_ .
the service leaves little to be desired .
i would hate to see it if we did not order extra bbq .
they are horrible !
i loved the music and the vibe of the place .
i highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a bar to attend regularly .
"love mac 's products , but the service lost a sale ."
the service is fast and good .
then housekeeping never came to clean the rooms .
my favorite are the `` samurai balls '' .
it 's a no-nonsense place but with authentic japanese food .
i appreciate that a lot !
the service was horrible and the slowest i 've ever experienced .
the oreo blizzard was great !
i bought a whole setup and they cut me a great deal .
it 's going to be a long weekend of sausage .
the hand crafted cocktails were all amazing and a great start to the meal .
"however , i was terribly disappointed with the seating ."
mccarran is a solid airport .
this place has great prices for a nice vegas restaurant .
their gyro and greek salad are the best around !
daughter loves the crab puffs .
the bar and the restaurant is pretty good .
so she starts to push buttons and has a little attitude about it .
"my wife called and left a message , and no one ever called back ."
service is great .
"everything was fresh and good table side service - pepper , fresh parmesan etc !"
the salad did n't taste very fresh either .
while sometimes the service is slow the food more than makes up for it !
salads are good too .
stayed there for a work event one weekend but i loved the room !
everything was flavorful and fresh .
"over and over again , the cook gets it right the first time ."
thank you !
"because they were so busy , we sat at the bar ."
it was just the right amount .
"should have walked out then , we really should have ."
it was just too bad to deserve a _num_ because of that .
this place is not that good .
"additionally , tell them to bring on the spice they love a challenge ."
have yet to find a prime rib better .
they are the most gentle people i have ever had deal with my kids .
this sales person really went above & beyond !
"this is my favorite place to buy clothes , bar none ."
i was really disappointed at my last visit .
service is terrible and wo n't return .
had a beautiful brunch here .
was this place memorable .
it 's a great hole-in-the-wall place right on fremont street .
i drove around for an hour to avoid valet parking still nothing .
she 's obnoxious .
and service is piss poor and understaffed .
"it was bright , spotless , & cheery with an unexpected vintage diner feel ."
i must say that this is a great little bar .
"and , the owners are amazing people ."
the insurance person in the office is a complete liar .
the reason why i give it two stars is for the horrible service .
"a month passed , dog still had problems and could possibly be pregnant ."
i was treated so rudely that i will never come back .
this is the place to get fantastic and fast mexican food .
in the ladies room there is currently only one stall open .
in store is hit and miss .
service is friendly and quick .
the quality is missing from the service .
the food is prepared daily and is as fresh as it can get .
there were some small problems .
the best bar food i 've had in a long time .
room was gross and walls were paper thin .
service and food have always been good .
staff was very friendly .
unfortunately that is where the good news stops !
one of the best things is their take away service .
elephant bar and grill is americanized version of asian food .
these complaints were basically ignored till i got frustrated and left .
the pricing is very reasonable for the portion sizes and the quality .
they really ripped her off with unbelievable high charges of over $ _num_ .
the portion is always huge and i bring home leftovers .
selection is great .
the prices are very fair for the quality of the food .
i thoroughly enjoyed my meal there .
it 's two spoons of micro shrimp over cocktail sauce over shredded celery .
it was well worth the wait !
i just want to get inside .
"my husband and i looked at each other wondering , huh ?"
i love the southwest skillet .
service was good as usual .
the customer service was excellent !
to say i am disappointed is an understatement !
there 's a reason this place does n't have much business .
my mom got the asian chicken salad and loved it .
"cool drink specials , and the bar tenders seem to be good people ."
the work he does is top notch !
at one point i was switching the dresses out myself .
that 's why i eat here i love the foods authentic quality .
it sure was n't a pleasant stay .
they make them right there and are the best in town .
i recommend the pain killer drink .
staff was awesome and the food was delicious !
there are some sketchy characters wandering around this area .
the country toast was unreal ... very rich and savory .
he was so helpful and very nice !
chuck and joe are amazing .
"to top it off , the staff were all genuinely friendly and helpful ."
great place if you want to take the family to dinner and a movie .
i highly recommend tiger lily !
i was very disappointed .
the manager came over and just brushed everything off .
i love pita jungle !
"and of course , there 's the lovely heavenly bed ."
"really disappointed in this place , especially since the other reviews are so good ."
the only problem is that nothing is updated .
i recommend any of the crepes .
not one person except our server smiled or acknowledged us !
the only good thing about the place is their margs .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
they 're honest and provide good service .
is always one of my favorites .
it 's totally divine .
i loved looking around at all the different items .
the service sucks and there food is not good .
"the portions were good , service was great ."
that did n't sit well with me .
may try this place again but was n't what i expected .
another companion got the german chocolate cake which was also dry .
$ 20+ for soul food that was so bad .
thank you .
we wasted another _num_ minutes or so getting onto another shuttle .
danny the gm and taylor are hands down the best employees they have .
i love this place .
i love the breakfast burritos .
"they are professional , friendly , and considerate of the patients ' time ."
this is a great sandwich shop .
she went through my options and helped find a bike that fit me well .
she then told me i was disturbing the other patients !
"if you go , expect long wait times for basic curry and rice ."
for twenty dollars it 's a great deal for a darn good haircut .
it is a very good chinese fast food and good price .
we love this place .
"well , it looks like i am back to square one ."
"the waitresses , well they left a lot to be desired ."
"when i asked her for chopsticks , she just walked away ."
food in the past was n't all that good to begin with .
the shows are so entertaining and the food is perfectly prepared .
amanda was nice and nancy was able to answer questions .
from this point on he has an attitude .
their pasta was very dry ( yes even with the sauce ) .
the food is n't stellar for how much it costs .
they got my car in right away and were done in an hour .
i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
i always leave with a very full tummy and its overall very satisfying .
they offer great soup and salad choices as well .
this airport is the absolute best .
"while the food was fine , it just was n't great ."
the pizza oven is still broken .
my pasta came burnt ( crispy noodles ! )
they have an amazing selection at their complimentary breakfast buffet .
pollo con queso was so good too .
their delivery service is one of the fastest i have seen !
last friday i came in around 6pm and ordered a fruit spinach salad .
i was wrong .
best food i 've had in a long time .
it was served with a pink sauce .
i backed away from the counter and got the hell out of there .
had my first charlotte color and cut today here !
"our waiter was excellent , i think his name was tom ."
i highly recommend this shop based on my experience .
they refuse to remove me from their call list .
what a mistake that was .
the facility and staff are great .
the food is mediocre at best .
the red sauce on the burro was great as well .
it was amazing .
it 's a unique garden with good variety and unusual plants .
service was great as well .
rubio 's is definitely fast food done right !
she said the hygienist was nice though .
they just want to get you in and out .
"the bag did not came with a box , only a dust bag ."
the problem i had was the type of people that low price attracts .
the bacon was like beef jerky .
just got back from this place and it was fantastic .
the salsa is mild and has a great taste !
she had no energy .
the chicken sandwich is my favorite .
"finally , my chicken was overlooked and sand paper dry ."
not worth the _num_ bucks we just spent here .
"some people enjoy this trash , i on the other hand have higher expectations ."
there was really nice entertainment .
my favorite item is the beef burrito !
the horchata was the best and again did n't taste watered down .
ordered the beef wellington and it was done right .
but it was so bad here i ca n't even do that .
the people here are so nice !
i do n't want to listen to that crap ever .
was not good at all .
they warm it up for you and have it ready shortly .
and dr. erika is awesome very thorough !
the food was just so bland and lacked the quality it use to have .
we love the olive garden !
there was n't a cleaning crew or any activity .
it is what it is .
my tostada was so soggy it was disgusting .
they never have my make up in stock .
these people are nice and remember my mother and i everytime .
the man serving me was very rude .
i am paying $ _num_ per night .
"if you do not specifically enjoy sushi , this is not for you ."
"the owner , mary , is a hoot and treats her customers right !"
this is just unbelievable .
"thank you honda west , for absolutely nothing ."
however this location is a disappointment to the brand .
the soups were amazing .
i called it in and hubby picked up to bring home .
"if you know me , you know i love anything to do with sandwiches ."
the cat fish was too spicy .
"i spoke with christine , a manager of member services ."
i was beginning to think she did n't speak english .
"the service was great , we really enjoyed eating here ."
the entire place is dirty and tired .
i did n't finish it nor take the leftovers home .
the dilly bird sandwich is awesome .
our group of six ate there on a friday night .
"on a sunday morning , i found this place to be quite dark ."
really enjoyed our season pass this summer at big surf .
to get my families lunch needs taking care of .
we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken .
we very highly recommend banner .
"ali was competent , quick and cheerful ."
drinks are great .
the salsa is fresh and super chunky !
the owner comes out and says he is not ready .
the food was excellent !
i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .
( it started _num_ days ago ) .
everything we ordered was perfect and the service was impeccable .
they had a great smoke flavor to them .
i waited for _num_ minutes .
would n't go back if they paid me .
loved it !
the seating is substandard at best .
"our most recent visit , however , was disappointing ."
"the service was great , fast and friendly ."
what i got was a big disappointment .
"the apartment is very nice and modern , clean ."
i dropped off my documents a month before the tax due date .
first i ordered a diet coke that was watered down .
this place is a real gem !
i had a great time looking at all the great antiques .
i was pissed off .
i would recommend it to anyone who lives or visits the las vegas area !
"all i went there for was an oil change , that was all ."
the milk tea itself was good and had a strong taro taste .
the server was n't around much at all and forgot my wine .
"every time my boyfriend and i eat here , it has been great ."
they have piano music in the bar to enjoy while having a drink .
"the power steering was working great , so long as the engine stayed on ."
the food is bland and tasteless and over priced for what you get .
it looked like high school in between classes in there .
first of all the service here was slower than slow .
this place was awful from the get go .
it is a great date spot to take that special someone .
i just moved to the area and went in without an appointment or designer .
top of head was halfway done .
i 'm from texas and they made me feel right at home .
"desk staff were just ok , bartender was rude ."
you have lost yourself steady business .
what 's wrong with them !
breakfast is served !
not what we expected at all but we had fun .
i love it !
"schnitzel , red cabbage , potato pancakes are excellent ."
i love this place !
i called and ordered delivery on a salad and a drink .
"what a lovely restaurant , food was delicious , service was awesome ."
the service is great .
i was charged $ _num_ to be made to feel like shit .
mom & dad also loved this place .
the service was ok but could have been better .
lol hope it stays this way !
noodles and broth were sufficient in quantity and quality .
( mostly because they refuse to really listen to my initial explanation . )
i have been a long time weekly customer of this car wash .
my almond mocha was fantastic .
and some sort of egg roll ... still not sure what was inside .
is amazing !
inside is very beautiful and the food is delicious .
they always play music way too loud .
that 's not that worst part .
"the food : sliders , seafood and wraps were surprisingly good for bar food ."
on a nice sunny day it 's a beautiful shot of the city .
nice wine selection and service was terrific .
"tomatoes are fresh and good , too ."
"certainly , there are better places for breakfast ."
"thought it was pretty good , pretty solid selection for the price ."
the salad was crisp fresh and abundant .
i love this restaurant .
there appeared to be only two servers working plus one cook .
the cashiers look like they hate their job too .
"you must make reservations , but it is well worth it ."
it was recommended by a friend and did n't disappoint .
"moreover , hertz tried to add a $ _num_ charge to my credit card ."
"the store is clean , with wide aisles ."
i usually have better results and never have to worry .
my family has eaten here many times .
there was also a decent selection of vintage posters .
so i went to this place a few times .
needs a complete overhaul or it wo n't make it much longer .
finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structure and checked in .
service is excellent .
love love love my glasses !
i highly recommend staying at the wynn for any vegas trip .
prices are cheap and the food is `` meh '' .
all in all it was a lackluster diner and dining experience .
wifi worked just fine .
love you diamond !
thank you so much for all you 've done .
the food is really average and pricey .
is n't that the point of having a restaurant ?
i truly felt welcomed and special on my day !
staff is very friendly and food is great .
"delivery is always fast , and the pizza is good ."
i love the wings and the cajun shrimp wrap !
we threw out the meat and just ate the brown rice and macaroni salad .
the bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese .
i really liked the service and the quality of their entrees .
the associates saw me waiting but just walking towards the other way .
i recommend the seared ahi !
the owner walks around and know most of his clients by name !
staff is always polite and knowledgable .
definitely will be staying again when we do our fall drive !
"the food was cold including the soup , fries ."
stayed here _num_ nights .
this is a great place for lunch .
i sadly have a mixed review .

we always sit in the lounge and we love it !
"anyways , still worth to try because the food and service are both great !"
"ok , a bit of explanation why i gave this place _num_ stars ."
the food was hot and fresh and well prepared .
this place is always empty .
"right now , my shower water does n't heat up ."

happy hour is fun and it is close to home .
it was a horrible experience .
i have never written a food review before .
food was poorly prepared .
"service by thomas was a+++ , very attentive and caring ."
i have traveled a good amount in my life .
"this place is packed , always ."
it took over _num_ hour and _num_ minutes to get our food .
classes are packed but very high level instructors .
this dealership is a joke ... absolute garbage .
our waiter was a kick and generally added to the fun .
shocked at how good the hot wings are at this place .
this is a great place to hike in the valley !
what really made this plate `` pop '' was how well everything was seasoned .
when you get to the bottom there is absolutely nothing to do whatsoever .
there were a few empty tables ... though most were dirty .
the service was good .
"had we just left it at that , our experience may have been better ."
i love this dentist too .
"unsanitary , disorganized , and poor customer service ."
i feel like everyone here has an attitude problem .
i really enjoyed this buffet .
i was impressed .
"yes , it is probably as good as it gets for a sandwich place ."
always good vibes when i go there .
"if there is a zero star option , i would give them that ."
very sad that nothing is there anymore .
"i have only had my i phone _num_ for _num_ months , already broken !"
they have a nice selection of beer and wine and it is reasonably priced .
this hotel is a piece of crap !
"even with these challenges , parks electrical did a great job !"
quit going there .
"food is great , prices are decent ."
thank you and we will be back for sure !
wed trivia is also the best i 've been to .
they make me sick to my stomach .
sun valley never told me this .
"in frustrating , i said `` jesus !"
i appreciate that kind of customer service .
bartender did acknowledge that he owed us our drinks .
"it took them awhile to make them , but well worth the wait ."
"my favorite is the hot green hatch , they are spicy and very flavorful !"
"for the prices at this place , i had hoped for so much more ."
all the staff are courteous and professional .
she is spectacular .
the fresh guacamole is delicious and so are the margaritas .
best wings in az is right !
i loved the super hero movie adventure .
"ohhhh yeah , it 's saturday !"
i was very disappointed with how gucci in scottsdale treated me .
i suppose you could do worse for a hotel restaurant .
it was ridiculous .
the cocktails are great too !
this is my new favorite weekend breakfast spot !
this week we had out of town family visiting from california .
i love this place .
she was extremely professional and the best .
this is definitely a true midwest neighborhood type bar !
the service is quick and friendly .
price for rooms were great .
"never received any communication regarding upcoming events , classes , discounts etc ."
mac 'n ' cheese is super inconsistent .
this place is amazing !
constant checking in with to make sure we were good .
this place is fantastic for what it is !
good music and nails love it here wo n't go no where else now .
"it takes a little longer for a color , but it 's worth it ."
my waiter was really cool too .
i hate the mexican food in las vegas for the most part .
but they are delicious and huge and the fries are great too .
"if you want to enjoy a meal for your money , go elsewhere ."
looking back it has been here for at least _num_ years .
the waffles are beyond delicious .
"it was about 2-3 pm in the afternoon , not busy at all ."
"pool sucks , parking is $ _num_ a night at the hotel ."
i came to this place years ago when i first moved to the valley .

the parking lot was full which made us regret choosing this place to eat .
staff is great and very friendly .
we then waited an additional _num_ minutes past the original appointment time .
rainbow is better .
this place is so good .
it was embarrassing to say the least and a real disappointment .
for a large pizza it costs _num_ and up .
i finished the transaction not wanting to argue .
i love the ambiance .
one thing i really love about todai is the fried rice .
vegetarians have limited choices here .
"tvs are great , the pizza is amazing ."
i walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving .
"the service was quick and friendly , and the food was great !"
but it 's one of my three `` go-to '' mexican spots .
they 're all super friendly and the good comes out super fast as well .
"every hd dealership has great people , you just have to connect ."
"this is the best place to go to , look no where else !"
christina the esthetician is also great .
after we placed our order he brought out the cheese and the dipping sides .
i love this hotel .
they have a very nice waiting area with two tvs .
ranch never came and poor quality bbq sauce .
this place is so much better !
they just handed me the money and turned around .
they have really great hours as well .
i asked for cheese got none .
my boyfriend and i definitely enjoyed our weekend stay here .
"clean cut , polite and he knew his stuff ."
thank you so much for all of the help you are both so wonderful !
we bought a beautiful dress for my girlfriend .
food was great it was a neat experience cooking our own food .
so the fremont street experience is not exactly family friendly .
"aside from that , the walls are very thin ."
sodas and tea are $ _num_ ( more expensive than a beer ) .
there 's just no follow up .
i greatly appreciated this excellent customer service .
in the last few weeks this store has improved _num_ stars .
"overall , if i do go back i 'm trying something else ."
the spice is perfect and the curries are spot on and delicious .
the pastor was very tasty as carne asada .
okay this pissed me off !
"the bar was all regulars and that was cool , everyone knew everyone ."
i decide i want no part if this scene .
none of them were cleaned .
they 've got plenty of other drinks on the menu as well .
they also cleaned up the rooms after each day .
it is one of the worst ever airport agent experiences .
the service is lacking n here 's why !
however it still has plenty going for it .
fourth or fifth time i 'm here and i love this place !
the flowers looked fantastic and the folks at sun city were very friendly .
they have great customer service and follow up .
i highly recommend them .
went in on a tuesday morning at 10:30 to get my ring repaired .
the ingredients are very fresh and the atmosphere is really nice .
the receptionist was very nice and helpful with questions i had .
no one near us knows how to cook fajitas .
it 's always a good experience .
"egg rolls , spring rolls that gave me fat rolls ."
the meat was dry and had no flavor .
i just love this place .
"while the apartments are alright , they 're certainly not worth the price ."
both times we have also had very friendly service .
jim answered all my questions and provided me with an really good offer .
we found my dress in about an hour & had a great time !
"it 's _num_ outside in phoenix , az ."
the staff is super friendly and helpful .
this is what $ _num_ valet get you here .
very authentic and they cook their own pan ( sweet bread ) as well .
i did n't even get service .
the service is great and they have an assortment of vegetarian friendly options .
the food is just about the best -- we like the pork taquitos .
"plus , they carry almost every size known to woman !"
they have crappy customer service and rude incompetent people on their staff .
i was so offended by how poorly i was treated during our phone call .
"like any other asian restaurant the wait staff , they speak limited english ."
i enjoyed the beef vermicelli dish .
it was really empty the night i went in for dinner .
with a drink my bill came to $ _num_ .
he always talks about how a dish can be improved .
this is a great place for some pizza and wings .
working with fred thomas was a great experience and very easy .
the staff is knowledgable and insightful !
"they are very inexpensive , have good food and are fast !"
"i ordered the lobster , shrimp and crab legs , potato and rice ."
the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .
the wife is friendly .
"as usual , the food and service were great ."
dang their ribs were great .
for many many years i have enjoyed this restaurant .
everyone is friendly and the service is fast .
"once inside , i found it was worth the drive ."
then i was lied to about the repairs being done in the store .
"service was pretty lackluster , despite it being a slow time ."
i recommend them to my friends all the time .
not the least bit pretentious and all the servers seemed in good spirits .
to begin the atmosphere is classy and comfortable .
it looked like she didnt do anything !
this safeway is so so so slow !
thank you !
the human race has jumped the shark .
i had a good experience with crown cab .
oh and love there thai ice tea !
she provides super customer service .
the food is great .
they pointed in a general direction and just kind of walked off .
his staff is great too .
this place is awesome !
i ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
i also loved the vintage sign and posters in the bar .
the fries were so good !
i am now finding out that they charge for the internet .
everyone here is so friendly and happy to help anyway they can .
at most they deserve at _num_ .
i did n't even like it .
i was told all kinds of problem and will cost $ _num_ .
unknown to me until recently my parents quit ordering from this location also .
your sign out front said _num_ % off between 4pm and 6pm .
i was so confused !
"we waited another _num_ minutes , still no fajita meal ."
"it is affordable , filling , and delicious ."
"additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e ."
the shrimp were way overcooked and the entire meal lacked any real flavor .
i bought a bag to take home .
have brought all of our visitors here for a nice dinner !
our family loves sweet tomato .
hopefully i can go back soon because it was absolutely worth the drive .
car smells soo good .
i was quite disappointed at what i saw .
the pizzas we ordered were great .
my parents and i have been using ernesto 's for years !
"actually , i 'm sitting in a hilton room as i type this ."
it was well explained and great .
no continuing maintenance is going on .
staff not friendly i felt like i was being followed around the whole time .
the place was n't even busy that night .
they were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with .
"the bike fed red is a good , too ."
i was n't bothering anyone nor was i costing them any extra money .
it 's a few blocks off carson and well worth the walk .
thank you for your expertise and professionalism .
but the service and the wait staff are the absolute worst .
they 're the best of the best .
"every time i want to relax , bella nails is go-to spot ."
the food is just incredible here .
"the room was quiet , spacious and clean ."
"i ordered the emerald kale salad , absolutely the best !"
"check this place out , it is worth it !"
we definitely recommend the melting pot to everyone !
the owners are always pleasant and makes the experience that much more enjoyable .
it 's also a great place to study or get some work done .
the waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready .
the potato pancakes rock !
the mac and cheese and desserts are incredible .
the main problem is the walls are very thin .
the staff knows their stuff and the web page is awesome .
"i swear , even the outdoor lighting has been removed !"
i have seen several movies here and it 's always been good .
it looked like she was even serving on the floor at times .
i really enjoyed my crab cake salad as well .
and the salmon was too salty even for me .
this is cu 's top-notch coffee shop .
they make them fresh right in front of you .
"this year , it 's been nothing but a disorganized mess ."
this is the worst hospital .
she then went back to doing whatever she had been doing .
"is great , and the ice tea is the best anywhere !"
has a nice crisp texture and soft inside .
his poor assistant did everything herself .
i just recently moved in this area .
"serving associates are always attentive , courteous and accommodating ."
the walls were paper thin .
this place is awesome !
it serves a purpose for everyone .
service is always fast even on a busy night when its packed .
"in terms of watching sports , this is n't a great place ."
this place is the best hair salon in the valley .
after kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional .
the ceremony was fairly priced and our minister was very warm and friendly .
service was amazing from the front door and with everyone we encountered .
she quoted me _num_ over the phone .
i somehow woke up with bug bites on my arm .

"so we were late , ... and there was n't a crowd here ."

everything on the menus is yummy !

"but , if service does n't bother you then this place has good bbq ."
"so with that being said , _num_ stars ."
"the staff was knowledgeable , friendly and thoroughly professional ."

i love that this target has the full grocery now .
happy hour prices are good too .

"he was informative , respectful , and honest ."
i really like this place .
i look forward to coming back !
i had the breakfast sandwich and it was a good helping of food .

so i went to this location and was told they were sold out .
the staff was very knowledgeable and caring .
this is the worst office i 've ever been to !
salad just a salad and the bread was cold .
amazing customer service and they always kept in touch with me .

"so overall ... it was ok , not great , but ok ."
he 's been wonderful to us and i hate that we 're losing him .
teriyaki bowl was terrible .
they ruined my brand new expensive suit .

made my dogs feel comfortable .
they have a full menu of italian fare and it 's all good .
i loved loved loved the little brie sandwiches with the tomato soup .
"i did , and had a nice relaxing time ."

my entire experience with this complex was horrible .
i wish i could leave a no star rating .
the workers here are really rude and mean .
well today we had the worst experience ever .
but how do you get fries wrong ?
"i mean , my money is green is n't it ?"
i like all the food here !
it will be nice to have postino there when it finally opens too .
worst security at any venue i have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks .
and it 's not cheap for the food they serve you .
"as expected , the casino is smoking ."
the chicken parmesan was burnt on the edges and the sauce was not flavorful .
cops and security have attitudes and are rude despite family event .
the facility is beautiful and well equipped .
and for an added bonus they have a pretty good scotch selection .
the spicy was the right amount .
"after this experience , i warn everyone to stay away ."
i was very disappointed with the service .
the food was not good .
i was very wrong .
the golden egg roll is convenient as it 's right near where i live .

"the sandwiches are alright , however there are no sides or chips ."
love you peaks !
this would be unacceptable at the doctor 's office i work at .
i would n't stay there again for what it cost .
is anyone with me on this ?
the food is lackluster at best without much variety nor flavor .
i easily give this museum `` _num_ '' stars !
loved !
"going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?"
this place was a total waste of my limited time .
"which makes it ok , i guess ."
all of them were because i was hungry and nothing else was open .
but whatever i order seems boring and uninspired .
this place is worth the long line at lunch time .
the slot rewards are very friendly and the buffet is out of this world .
staff is super friendly .
sound is appalling if you 're not square in front of stage .
it was a blast !
"it was n't bad , but it was n't amazing ."
the food is good and the staff is friendly .
i enjoy doing business with them .

there is nothing worse than a lukewarm shower .
there was barely any gravy on the potatoes .
"now , i understand taking _num_ carts may have been a little much ."
they serve the best michelada .
ca n't say this was a good experience and i wo n't be back .
no special fish taco sauce on the fish tacos like some places use .
the customer service sucks .
the pizza was just ok .
"water park was small and unimpressive , but nice as a bonus maybe ?"
the nurses were kind and compassionate .
each time there has been a good experience .
the cocktails are old school and great !
i have only been there once but probably wo n't go again .
the vegetables were overcooked and the dishes lacked flavor overall .
food on the other hand was mediocre and a bit on the greasy side .
i was very happy with the decision .
i always bring friends here when they come to town .
so much so that it is all i ever order there .
servers clearly do not know what they even have here .
"my parent 's love this place and now , so do i ."
is it the best chinese food in vegas ?
both were great and one of the best spots for pizza around .
it is $ _num_ a person .
"other than that , we quite enjoyed our stay ."

an there 's always a favorite on tap .
it 's affordable and they are super with my babies .
did i mention the sign asking clients to leave their kids at home ?
also they use high quality jewelry at this shop .
this is a scam used by jewelers to sell people more expensive jewelry .
my favorite is the birthday cake ice cream in a waffle cone .
he comes back with a _num_ dollar gas voucher and a terrible attitude .
he was clueless and just stood there with his mouth hanging open .

hertz just lost a loyal customer !
the manager was really nice and apologetic .

it was worse than anything you can imagine .
"when i opened an account here , this fee did n't exist ."
they also have some of the best milkshakes .
they obviously have a new chef and the friendly staff is gone .

knowledgable and friendly associates who made buying a new grill an enjoyable experience .
there food was good when it first opened .
i looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables .
i totally get that this is a dive bar .
what you might not expect is the flavor !
the inside of the car was n't real dirty .
"_num_ minutes went by again , no first round ."
had the pho today to go and it was delicious .
they do n't .
mussels are great ... actually everything is .
this cigar bar has a great humidor and an excellent staff .
ah probably cuz it 's the only kfc here in ahwatukee .
"everything we ordered was delicious , the lamp chops were the best !"
about the name : the pizza box says `` famous rays '' .
it has little cheese and is not flaky .
this place is very fast and all the nail techs are very polite .
thank you honda west !
with that being said my dining experience last night was a treat .
we loved the effect in the pictures .
"no , wait , that might actually taste better than what it was ."
"frozen margarita was sub-par , a bit weak ."
the toast would have been good if it was warm .
this was a good experience .
this place is a must when you visit vegas .
it took over _num_ minutes for our food to be served .
this was room _num_ .
"i never complained to the restaurant manager , but did email corporate ."
"then i repeated , `` a dozen , please '' ."
this store now has a loyal customer in me !
they have italian pastas and then they have their noodle options which were confusing .
desserts were outstanding .
it is my favorite place to eat .
this place does not seem to care if they have any customers .
both tasted like the kind of cheap frozen appetizers you 'd buy at albertsons .
their antipasto special was heavenly and the pasta i had was delicious too .
a good stop for decent mexican if you are at sunset station .
the room is about _num_ feet by _num_ feet larger than the bed .
i loved the cozy atmosphere with kitschy decor including local art .
our single car door has a room built in the garage ...
overall it was a friendly and painless transaction .
it 's fabulous !
i made an appt and they never showed up and never called to apologize .
it really makes a difference .
always polite and get the order correct which is unusual for taco bell .
there really is no discount .
"for the most part , the wax figures are well done ."
the store it 's self is clean and they have complimentary water .
the wait staff did n't seem to care at all .
they were huge and so tasty !
i ended up getting two turkey wraps .
love this place and the family that runs it !
"great price also , worth _num_ _num_ times what i paid ."
hubby n i are not the hard customers type .
i was hooked from then on !
this place was a disappointment .
friday night fish fry is awesome !
she told me the owner was out of town now for several weeks .
vets are great !
they have really good fries too !
customer service is lacking .
really poor service and way overpriced .
it 's worth a trip here just for the home brews .
i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .
how can a mexican restaurant get mexican food so wrong ?
"never never do business with them , i know i wo n't ."
the staff is amazing .
but i feel so comfortable and so relaxed in her office .
the place is clean and they always are very polite .
nearly everyone 's been funny and the staff is always nice .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
"now , this crap is garbage ."
they did n't seem to care very much .
the service was very good .
the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .
"the sauce is tasteless , and just that , canned tomato sauce ."
the vanilla and coffee chip were good but the chocolate was excellent .
the oysters are perfectly crisp and huge !
macaroon ice cream sandwhich was great .
then we walks away .
i walk back into the dealership and then wait around .
clean place though and it was empty ... _num_ people including myself .
"thanks guys , i really appreciate what you 've done !"
i also valued the beer collection and believed the atmosphere was inviting .
it was also very tasty .
"alfredo , our waiter barely acknowledged our request but we knew he heard us ."
always good ... watch the service because they are busy .
we went for my boyfriend 's birthday and it was a wonderful experience .
this place sucks if you 're an adult .
the view is phenomenal .
it was like pulling teeth trying to get simple things like refills and utensils .
and i 've always had excellent service and thought the price was fair .
been a patron at rubio 's for a long time ; this one included .
"food has always been hot , fresh , and good ."
"he did an excellent job , and was very neat and professional ."
the herbal salad was so good - never had anything like it before !
"he was terrific , patient and extremely helpful ."
comes with this sweet and sour sauce stuff you pour on top .
homemade meat sauce is fantastic .
service was great .
it 's difficult to turn left across broadway at morning rush hour .
we all had a really good meal .
this place is awesome .
service and staff are very attentive and friendly .
"omg , this place is amazing !"
we also ordered wings and liked them .
prices are reasonable ... certainly the best and one of the closest to campus .
"i have my receipt , as well as the charge on my bank card ."
the wait staff was friendly and attentive .
"ordered an omelette , eggs benedict , and egg sandwich ."
i never knew there was a great barber in the neighborhood until today .
i really love this place .
the delivery guy was super sweet and called when he arrived .
it was a mix of ingredients that just did n't work .
we had a lovely evening here .
i had a great experience here .
the food was pathetic .
they were absolutely artificial and flavorless .
"oh yeah , and the food is good too ."
it was great !
seeing wild horse along the river was the topping on the cake .
the restaurant itself is a little outdated .
"made me feel very comfortable and it was painless , very professional ."
horrible is an understatement !
the whole thing tasted and felt boxed and pre-made .
it 's really good .
how difficult is it to fuck up a chicken fried steak ?
"we recommend them highly for their professionalism , quality , and outstanding customer service !"
the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .
the view of the water i think is really terrific .
the place was packed for the lunch hour with construction workers from the area .
killed what i loved about el cortez _num_ yrs ago .
thank you excalibur !
was n't too smoky either .
the staff are really friendly and pretty helpful .
"the chef and staff were friendly , funny , and so much fun ."
bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry .
this did not make me happy .
the rest of the meal she did n't come back to our table .
i wasted my time and money coming here .
the tv channels they offer you are very limited as well .
my favorite is the shawn roll ; so good !
i will make this place a regular stop when business brings me to phoenix !
she was very nice and gave us great service .
and that itself shows how much dedicated they are with their patients .
another hour was waited just to get called to the back .
this place is for real people .
"it just seemed so shady , and absurd !"
thank you sierra !
he was really mad .
we stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and we had an excellent experience .
they need to train ppl basic customer service skills .
shelves are stocked up !
we just love eating here !
this is not how filipino food should taste like !
there are better places to stay for the money .
i had to wait another few minutes for the guy to fry the bacon .
i love the outlets at anthem !
"bottom line : if you need oral surgery , look elsewhere ."

pizza and sandwiches are awesome .
i love the all you can eat at this place ... .
the chicken and shrimp were okay but the salad was slimy .
"on my visit here , the service was fine ."
this place is amazing .
food is good all american fare .
this place attracts a lot of older people .
all the old people eating lunch here did n't seem to notice .

there was so much info on nevada and lots of interesting displays .
i have recommended this to other friends and will continue to do so .

me and my husband hate the food here .
food is also very good .
"the service was great , food was fast , everything was perfect ."
cars are amazing .
"but if they 're no good with it , why offer it at all ?"

this has to be the worst place i 've eaten a long long time .
i gave em the `` _num_ min '' benefit of the doubt .
i tried everything !
everyone else was horrible .
the room was really nice and clean .
coworkers that normally clean their plate only finish part of it .
i love the seafood center because of the excellent fish fry .
the worst management i have ever had to deal with .
it was awesome !
it 's a nice little neighborhood .

i 've never been to a hotel that does n't serve past 2pm .
they were so condescending and rude the entire appointment .
i guess that 's a pet peeve of mine .
the service and food was fantastic !
these donuts are delicious and priced well .
the restaurant gives a real tired appearance .
they are n't very friendly there at all either .
the tartar sauce they gave me may as well have been mayonnaise .
i highly recommend taking the afternoon tour .
this has to be one of my most favorite italian restaurants in scottsdale .
pedicure was a rush .
today 's meal failed even that low standard .

"great food , we found our favorite place for chinese food here on az !"

i really like this place .
i went downstairs to get water bottles .

"unfortunately , this is n't the first time this has happened ."
they also smothered the tacos with some creamy sauce .
felt more like a la quinta to me - in a good way .
my wife ordered the fish special and was quite disappointed .
some secrets are best kept secret .
that is not a caesar salad .
the manager john is always in such a great mood and very helpful .
i just came back from my yearly trek to las vegas .
-they did n't check my id as i went into the line for tsa .
this is my second attempt here .
it is very natural looking yet gives her eyes the definition they needed .
this place is awesome .
i had a lot of fun here .
chairs in the dining room have obviously never been cleaned .
i had the sizzling fish tacos that consisted of overcooked tilapia and flavorless veggies .
the arena employees are kinda jerks about telling guest about this rule .

this place is crack .
the appetizers are yummy and filling and can be a full meal .

"preston , our waiter was so patient and friendly ."
also this place has gone down hill in the clean dept .
their hoagies are also very good .
the food was fresh and prepared perfectly .
ca n't remember the last time i had a manicure .

the portions were n't that generous either .
the chicken shawarma is as good as it gets .
"no , we do n't even have time to eat or meal ."
the food was excellent .
the bruschetta is delicious as well as the tomato and mozzarella dish .
we have always been extremely happy with the service we have received .
if you are not expecting a lot you might like it better .
there was no means to reach a human being .
i love this place !
they did a good job .
"he is caring , patient and very thorough ."
food is amazing .
"also when i just checked , there were no uber cars available ."
i did n't find all of the staff to be overly professional .
"both times , they apologized and caught the error , but it happened twice ."
"he was charming , professional and personable ."
these guys definitely deserved a yelp .
staff is rude and not helpful .
if i wanted to get my own food i 'd stay home and cook .
the food is wonderful .
"most importantly , i love the messages they share every sunday ."
all of them hit the spot .
"the pasta itself was very good , as long as it was sauce free ."
that 's what i get for trying to save money on a oil change .
the music is fun and tunes everyone knows .
i love caffe boa !
the men there were so friendly and speedy !
the pho broth was very flavorful and came with fresh basil and bean sprouts .
i love to watch the different styles of dancing .
the service provided here was phenomenal .
i have a long flight back home and i 'm starting to get hungry .

i enjoy this hotel and this is my second or third stay .
thank you christina .
jake is amazing !
"it 's a gaming establishment , do n't you comp drinks all day long ?"
i wish i could give zero starts .
they have an express counter with pre-made food .
"when they offer the pumpkin curry , get it -- fantastic !"
my wife had the eggplant parmesan which was delightful .

"the filet mignon was cooked to perfection , as always ."
i always look forward to coming in .
my boyfriend 's family and i started our vacation at this dump .
"there are gates , but no good if they do n't work ."
_num_ star is _num_ too many !
they moved quickly yet carefully .
the price is right the people and service are extraordinary .
it sucked .
that was the only good thing about my meal !
the employees did n't even offer to help get him his stuff back .
tacos are great .
i tried very hard to give this place a chance .
she was so incredibly rude to our family !
the store is clean and fresh .
"whats even better , is they treat you with respect ."
this has nothing to do with the techs at all .
the security lines are horrible on a regular basis .
it took _num_ people to go to lunch for at least _num_ minutes .
"our waitress lori was prompt , efficient and super friendly ."
the pizza is really good with wine .
i have had the very worst experience with them .
chips and salsa are great !
the food really was n't anything impressive .
she is a great bartender and a lot of fun to talk to .
i informed her the pizza was undercooked and to let the cook know .
the riviera came up and the price was very cheap .
actually there was nothing basement like about it .
the food is even better than the ambience .
total time spent : _num_ hrs !
i told the owner why we were leaving and he yelled at us .
only got in two little bites and i was done .
"aside from that , the desserts were good ."
the medium wings were a perfect appetizer along side there brown bread .
it is worth it just to go for the `` show . ''
loved the shrimp burrito and fish tacos .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
the restaurant itself is really cute too .
also drinks insanely overpriced .
even the cooks messed up the steak order at the table next to us .
our waiter jessica was awesome !
"also had a couple of shredded beet tacos , very tasty !"
"i also had their crab and shrimp enchiladas , they were very very good ."
service was quick and i was in and out with my wings and flatbread .
the food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland .
the owners really help you .
"however in this case i must , if i am to tell the truth ."
most important is the price .
"dean of shadyside is very professional , everyone is really nice ."
service is slow .
service was friendly and helpful .
this is the best place to go for breakfast .
these are good to have good conversation with friends and to study .
i thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food and will definitely return .
by then i was frustrated by the whole experience .
the kitchen is in plain view of the customers which is nice .
"the sides were good too ... some flavored rice , and black beans ."
i enjoyed the pedi and will be returning for another .
i love these guys !
the majority of women who work here are very rude .
the acoustics are awesome and the space has a fabulous atmosphere .
"although the sicilian does n't blow my socks off , everything else is superb ."
"i 'm not a big burger person , but their burgers are amazing ."
"it really does n't taste that great , especially the pizza ."
welcome back viva 's !
"no one , that is who ."
the menu is a combination of seasonal and signature dishes .
i love this place .
this is my favorite chinese restaurant in mesa .
that 's not our usual practice . ''
and i do n't think i 'd recommend it to anyone either .
i almost walked out .
the prices are very reasonable .
it 's homey and it 's familiar .
`` the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups .
tortillas were not good .
i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone .
thank you judy .
the pumpkin bread is amazing and a delight .
i strongly recommend to visit this place if you fond of indian food .
they have a couple decent vegetarian options and the ambiance is fresh and clean .
we saw a _num_ movie and it was all old folks .
rick ( the tow truck driver ) was great !
"hands down , best wings i 've ever had anywhere ."
"they have great beers , personally the stout is the best option ."
challenging but fun and the scenery is great .
but i was quickly over that .
this place is awesome !
the cilantro dressing is tasty .
"the first time , it was n't bad ."
i am so torn with this place as another poster has said .
"btw , the bacon is amazing ."
"but please , please do n't insult me by serving what they call pizza ."
they certainly do not warrant their work nor take responsibility for their actions .
there 's some cheaper places and some more expensive .
i 'm not sure why i have n't reviewed this before .
the decor is like stepping into a diner from the late _num_ 's .
"despite giving chances over and over , every single time something is wrong ."
there was only one server and one manager who was the cook .
the shrimp were barely warm and slimy .
i highly recommend checking it out !
"food was good , service was great !"
it was awful .
it is right across from st. joe 's and it is always packed .
the diamond quality was horrible .
bryan was fast and did a perfect job .
microwave broke ; brought a replacement the same day !
the staff is friendly and will treat you like family here .
"_num_ minutes later , our wine arrived ."
this is a great place to take small kids for lunch or dinner .
sauce was plain .
i enjoyed my stay here !
it 's a piercing shop !
really liked the roll they used for the bun .
this is the best dental care in the valley !
i had ordered it with extra crispy bacon on the side .
this place is amazing !
"this is kinda take-out style , but does have tables ."
"unfortunately for my girlfriend though , the tattoo work was so so as well ."
the staff have always been so nice and provide great service .
the quality of the entrees and sides are first class .
this speaks well of management .
i do n't suggest coming here for a good time .
i originally gave them _num_ star but i did really like my massage .
"they were sooo nice and the coffee was great , hash browns cold ."
you can take as many pictures as you want .
unfortunately we received terrible service at the az mills location .
i dunno .
i also really like being able to email in an order ahead of time .
food does n't match the restaurant 's look and atmosphere .
we really enjoyed our visit .
i could n't believe what i was seeing .
the service was perfect .
this makes me not want to give them anymore of my money .
surprisingly the places was pretty empty .
the entire staff was great .
all in all ... dishonest & overpriced .
the tacos are great with everything on them !
it has reheated food and is definitely not authentic .
conclusion : i would never come back unless someone else paid for me .
people were literally waiting _num_ minutes for a table .
thank you for making my stay a great one !
i love elite cleaners .
we should have been tipped off by the fact that it was empty .
did n't receive a warm welcome from the management staff .
this place is real clean and service for the most part is great .
the price of the sandwiches was very good also .
this place by far exceeded my expectations !
the food was good .
the people who work here really make you feel at home .
"overall the atmosphere , service , and food are excellent ."
the chicken was delicious- and the tortillas were great .
the sweet and spicy wrap with grilled chicken is awesome !
lots of flavor and over all everything cooked perfectly .
"they are always nice , and make the best sandwich 's ."
you can tell that he is passionate about his state !
guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?
and the bread is super tasty .
they were busy ... too busy for my taste .
it is one of my favorite places to eat .
that 's excellent service !
"overall , a great place and their sale prices are awesome ."
the calzones are delicious too .
i even got a straw too !
the broth is on point and the noodles are always perfect .
"they are professional , extremely thorough and do a great job ."
try hiring more people so least an order is taken .
went here today for a flat tire patch .
the type of small business you want in your community .
she explained everything to us since it was our first time .
"too many tv 's to count , so you always have a great view ."
thank you !
we are very pleased with cost and service .
seriously this is basic diner fare nothing to rave about or be amazed with .
both were so good .
i went to the shell on eastern and serene with no problems .
"the owner , jackie , is very kind and personable !"
one of the potstickers i had tasted like it was made with rotten meat .
the big cinnamon twist too is a great one too .
i had a really rude experience today at sprouts in scottsdale .
food and serve is also excellent .
"usually packed with locals , a little divey ... love it !"
so $ _num_ for water and a bud light and she tipped herself ?
the food is not very good .
this is vet place not a bank .
"i 've even been to this place before , and passed their test ."
breakfast at the bistro is a relaxed culinary treat .
the service was bad and the food was worse .
that deserves more than three stars .
"it 's a one star rating by default , deserving of no stars ."
there is an ok number of beers on tap .
he was very rude right from the beginning .
it really left a bad taste in my mouth for the money we spent .
we met with a few companies in town .
of all the roberto 's this location is my favorite .
eating here is always a good value .
also had a hard starting problem when warm and slow power windows .
i think ramen noodles tasted better and cost only _num_ cents .
"the owner , justina , is hip , cool , gorgeous and awesome !"
"the cuisine is unique , but poorly prepared ."
they have some great breakfast sandwiches also !
course is in bad shape .
shit was good !
we always enjoy our dinner here .
that 's a shame .
thank you very much !
i would recommend the rainbow roll because of the citrus flavoring they put inside !
they have a great selection of breakfast overall .
then he hung up on me .
the price is high but worth .
it was gigantic with a really good brat on top .
he is a true asset to kona .
this place has exceptional food and staff .
"finally , she looked at my account and saw that i had canceled ."
best deal ever !
they are really accomodating here as well .
they deliver !
the lobster mac and cheese was very filling and very tasty .
and it was clean !
i can honestly say this is the worst one we 've ever been to .
my fries were actually as cold as the ranch .
the staff is responsive and accommodating .
"however , i recently missed an appointment ."
"sushi is good , rice is moist ."
i also loved the beans !
not one ounce of friendliness came from him .
it 's fairly large and clean .
but these were christmas presents and i needed them tonight .
but we left a wallet in our room and checked out .
the staff here are fantastic !
that 's half the reason why this place rocks !
i love this place .
"this place is great , come by and check it out !"
i never had this bad of service here .
everything is new and i love being the first to live in my apartment .
"they work fast , well , and for a great price !"
it is right across the street from my office .
"great barista staff , the grocery side of things is of course very nice ."
service is sketchy here at best .
as good as it gets .
the staff is great and always smiling .
this is absolutely the best middle eastern food in the valley .
the food was wonderful and the service great .
but the best part of this visit were the tortas themselves .
what made me want to review it was the bread !
"if you have a kid , definitely bring them here ."
fish dinner is excellent .
the food is still amazing .
"ok , but they do not go out of their way to help !"
we love it here .

manager was standing around .
"avoid this place , there are better bars not far away ."
they have fresh coffee while you wait .
being from california i have been spoiled when it comes to mexican food .
i much prefer carolinas when in the mood for a quick taco or burrito .
she rushed through and was extremely rude to me .
the management seemed completely clueless .
there was a female bartender with glasses who was extremely rude .
"no thank you , i 'll find another locally own restaurant to support ."
the burgers are sloppy and not stacked correctly .
the red card station attendants are the exact same way .
pei wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is .
this place desperately wants to upscale .
i also think it is great that they have the film lab next door .
the ladies are nice and their facials are awesome .
the tables and chairs are sticky and dirty .
i was surprised when i got my food and happy when i finished .
the cut was bad and the sides were a joke .
i wish i could give zero stars that 's how bad it was .
"great food , i ordered the orange chicken and white rice ."
this one seems to be managed well .
the veal parm is freaking amazing .
pretty cool place and the food was pretty good .
i was extremely impressed !
"if you buy your ticket in advance , you can get a great deal ."
the staff is so friendly & warm .
"unfortunately for those restaurants , `` them 's the breaks . ''"
it was basically falling apart and most of the games were awful .
tomato soup is excellent .
they make some delicious bread here !
"after _num_ + years in business , they are still going strong ."
even though its casual the service is always great .
staff is usually friendly and helpful .
this whole store is completely lack luster with customer service .
"men 's cut was $ _num_ , and worth it in my opinion ."
man they make a good sandwich here .
the conversations are great and genuine .
this is a really nice hotel .
fish and chips were perfect and some of the best i 've had anywhere .

thai rama is my favorite thai place in phoenix .
great food a little pricey but it 's always a great atmosphere .
; - ) it was very hot but still worth it .
"great place , they made a customer for life ."
the food was typical diner breakfast food .
the side dish was decent but not nearly enough .
it made the kids smile and started our trip off right .
"my hair was beautiful , soft , with lots of volume ."
this place needs to get there shit straight .
"i told them that this was impossible , as i have military coverage ."
i was really impressed .
lobster bisque was creamy with nice chunks of lobster .
there is no way that _num_ people use over $ _num_ worth .

he was easy to work with and friendly .
"so you know what that means , right ?"
that to me is a sign of good taste .
the food is good as well .

i tried some today for the first time so good !

boy was i wrong .
the food is fresh and healthy ( ish ) .
four stars is right on for this restaurant .

bathrooms are clean .
i love m & m world !
over a month period ( if not more ) my daughter was sick .
we will always stop here each trip we make .
came here with me and my _num_ friends we instantly were seated .
"awesome experience , the doctor was very nice ."
they are incredibly disorganized and the customer service is severely lacking in every regard .
this location is convenient .
", and the decor is generic and worn ."
also ran blood tests not related to me at all .

the staff is always willing to help and they 're very nice .
same non service for the man that came in afterwards .
the prices were fair and the ambiance was really nice .
"however , i was surprised by the reasonable beer selection and the nice menu ."
their signature dish `` chicken parm '' tasted like it was frozen and reheated .
the cooks here are lousy .
then you leave and pass the stinky cow again .
the employees come and go like any job but the staff is always friendly .
"he quoted pricing , and stayed true to his quote !"
i went to the az mills mall in tempe az .
this company should be ashamed how little they care about the children .
it just keeps getting worse .
"i highly recommend this clinic for affordable , world class care ."
whoever gave him that position made a terrible business decision .
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
he has a very conservative approach .
the staff is always super friendly and nice .
the original guys took _num_ mins for almost any sub .
"the courier is more comfy and affordable , and every bit as good ."
took my tray to the condiment area and it was stocked and clean .

this is a manager that appears to be related to ownership .
"come on , wynn , are you even trying ?"
still love carolina 's though !
the food was awful .
it was slow on that night .
these guys are the greatest .
the cost is very reasonable and the portions generous .

i once again stated why did you seat us then .
the restaurant selections are limited .
over cooked vegetables and really confused on what the meat was .
"the food is always good , and suits a variety of tastes ."
the karaoke host was just lame .
the produce and prepared foods are very fresh and enticing as well .
the place smells like delicious meats !

"she put the bowl down and walked away , washed her hands and apologized ."
"the view , of course , was phenomenal ."
"absolutely , the worst i 've encountered in a hotel ."
both my wife and i loved our meals .
loved that the waitresses knew the regulars by name !
"always crowded , loud and most of the time it smells like shit ."
this company has not even delivered our couch yet and we are already unhappy .
this place is so disgusting .
"which sucks , because i do n't have that color at home ."
the carpet was gross .
their croissants are always fresh and they have some amazing flavors .
"apparently , they are n't used to dealing with sophisticated , knowledgeable buyers ."
i paid extra to have my floor mats cleaned - what a mess !
everything is cooked to order and very fresh .
"a very few are n't , but that 's not the majority at all ."
the wings are nothing special at all .
they make going to the dentist a pleasure .
people go here to have fun for sure .
"it 's a bit creamy , but pretty good ."
the price they listed on the menu is not what you paid .
a great little spot worth the wait when there is one !
all of the electrical went out shortly after .
it sad you have to go and waste your time there .
i tried the steak burro enchilada style and it was delicious .

wow this place is fantastic !
the food was great !
"whatever you do , do n't order for delivery ."
everything is clean and we 'll taken care of .
"lastly , the jerk chicken was too jerky ."
spacious has tons of tables both full size and bar size .
omelette was one of the item which did n't disappoint me .
this hyatt was just dated and not to hyatt standards .
i walked in and was asked for an id .
_num_ hour has a good selection of machines .
"the flavors were rich , interesting and delicious ."
i was really impressed with their choice of vegan dessert .
the other macaroni and cheese another girl ordered was fine .

my wife is a huge fan of the wonton soup .
the food was good and the management sympathetic and helpful .

alright so this place is like food to my soul .
the store was in perfect order and i received excellent customer service today .
i seriously love this sandwich shop .
"her concerns were ignored and she , as a person , was ignored ."
i am a very happy customer !
it tasted more boiled than anything .
customer service sucks big time and owner or manager is rude .
"we do n't get this extra topping , just cheese ."
the dish was fantastic regardless .
"the soups are amazing , actually everything we 've had is amazing ."
now they have lost my business completely .
food is mediocre at best .
it 's my favorite .

there are maybe two that do look like they are not bitter tho .
he 's the best !
i love don at this nail salon !
nothing was done after that .

i went to pick it up and the hem was terribly crooked .
the `` lake '' nearby provides a good atmosphere .

i think the food is boring .
then i once wanted lettuce on my hamburger and they forgot .
"the enchilada sauce is outstanding , wonderful tacos , yummy cheese crisps ."

love this location because it is so close to my work .
the free rental car made life extremely easy while fixing my car .
i woke up one morning to find cockroaches crawling over my shoes .
everything else about the dinner was wonderful .
the prices are great for the work that they do .
guess i know why that location is a dive and always has been .
picking out our interior items was fun and turned out exactly as we expected .
those two items alone are mouthwatering and worth going there for .
their prices are reasonable and everyone here treats clients with the utmost of respect .
"i recommend the ice green tea , it 's great !"
their selection of estate jewelry is phenomenal .
"the prices are low , the portions large , and the food is delicious !"

"the wonton soup was good , especially the wonton filling ."
the staff is bright and smiley .
i say skip it and put your money elsewhere .
i love living here .
the lighting is dim so it has a touch of romance to it .
the service was very good .
"clearly , this area does not get cleaned or maintained at all ."
but that customer rep ruined everything .
"not to ask if everything was ok , not to refill drinks ."
it 's a blast .
i love how polite and professional they all are .
very tender meat and the pasta was great .
the only one under $ _num_ was without cheese .
shame on you camelback vw .
chuck box has the best cheese burger & fries next to whataburger .
extremely uncomfortable chairs that are obviously designed to urge you to go away .
not perfect but beats domino 's and some other ny style places .
it is an old smoke hole that smells like old grease .
i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .
needless to say they need to work on customer service .
the entire experience was the most awkward and weird haircut of my life .
the staff are always friendly and service is fast .
the server then went to our server and talked about it with attitude .
"from the bakery , you walk along a long meat wall ."
i highly recommend them for any propane needs .
he greeted me with a smile and helped me figure out what i wanted .
this little gem surprised me .
wow i was very happy to see that .
the best rack of lamb i 've ever had !
at one point i was wondering if the elevator was broken .
bed is rock hard and the lights in the bathroom do n't work .
lunches are fantastic as well .
the food and staff surely make up for it !
the inside atmosphere is nice and old school .
and now i 'm in vegas and this place still hits the spot .
we had lunch in the coffee shop and it was awful .
"foods great , love the burgers & garlic fries ."
the service was great- very friendly and quick .
"sorry mario 's i really wanted to like this meal , but no joy ."
it 's always the pink champagne with strawberry filling ... .
just as good as it sounds !
we had some other special requests and they were able to accommodate every one .
the owner was really cool too .
it was perfect !
"overall , i had a good experience ."
but it seems that their customer service gets worse with every single visit .
$ $ $ $ : are they freakin out of their minds ?
some of the best chinese food i 've had in a long time !
i had a smile on my face as i drove the freeway home !
everyone is very friendly .
the service is friendly .
i 've never felt ripped off by their service until today .
staff were very friendly and courteous .
i 'm sure they got thrown out .
i was n't impressed by the fish fry .
they have a good salsa bar .
staff was extremely friendly .
staff was courteous and served in a timely manner .
but this is a great airport considering it is vegas .
"food was mediocre , deserts were inedible ."
"the food is cheap , and the portions are large ."
i like going because it is very close to where i 'm currently located .
"`` expired may _num_ , _num_ '' ."
and then there 's a $ _num_ tax on top of that .
thank you for taking such good care of our fur baby .
if you 're in wickenburg and want a great burger this is the place .

cheese and fruit plates were wonderful .
i love this place !
it really is always a good consistent product .
they gave this place _num_ stars .
"after our wedding , i noticed that one of the diamonds fell out ."
we were in town visiting arizona and we found this barnes & noble .

it 's definitely bad traffic design on display .
enjoyed our dinner with a terrific view over looking the strip .
it 's definitely an experience !
wednesday is so gravy and biscuits .
"long story short , their awful customer service cost me business ."
these guys are the best !
please do not sing any more ... that 's all i want for christmas !
aaron brothers you 'll never see thomas s. again mart .
it was such a nice place to stay at .
i like the ring enough . ''
all of which i checked into when i was _num_ with no problems .
it sucked .
nothing really worked at all .
the staff is rude .
it seems the corporate office does n't even care about their customers .
"sleep on the carpet , what other solution is there ?"
"she talked constantly and advised us she was sick , great thanks !"
i loved it .
"food was fresh , tasty , perfectly seasoned ."
caribbean inspired cuisine .
"bottom line , there 's nothing they can do ."
"the hummus was okay , and our main plate seemed to be microwaved ."
the service is very inconsistent and this will be my last time going today .
i definitely recommend this place if you love a quality pretzel .
they were so great and crispy !
i have talked to managers in past and all they do is apologize .
"as a result , i missed my international flight ."
always have beautiful inventory and are willing to make the deal work .
it really is the best .
but i am about a rabbit and love my salads .
the worst dentist i have ever been too .
but this place deserves it .
our waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss .
"michael is honest , prompt , reasonably priced , and friendly ."
"also , there 's a starbucks in the store !"
"the egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo , with no taste at all ."
so this is my honest review of the place and probably my last too .
they run all their loud equipment before sunrise .
"i said no thank you , and got the roll of the eyes ."
a second employee came by with our waters a few minutes later .
"i left with too much food , but all of it was so good !"
sometimes the chili has zero beans in it .
but other than that a great place and prices are great as well .
have to say disappointed .
generous amount of food which satisfied our hunger .
changs is a weekly meal for our family !
definitely worth a try if you are in the area !
"he said for what , you do n't need anything and kept ignoring me ."
i frequent the southern california locations so i knew what to expect .
i hung up researched online and found you !
sweet & sour soup is tasty .
"that could have been my pizza , which was on the same stand ."
we had an amazing breakfast .

the food at this place is good .
i recommend anything on the breakfast menu .
we had a very good server .
the only thing that saved this dish was rice .
the meatball sub is fantastic .
i really did n't buy it as i had worked in restaurants before .
"they have great food , decent beer selection and its near the college ."

"we ordered so much food and a variety , for that matter ."
certainly a place is recommend and go back to over and over again .

there are a couple decent places to drink and eat in here as well .

the service is great - fast and friendly .
however ; it 's above par for a deli .

my first impression was that the dining room was extremely small and crowded .
the chips and salsa and hot sauce is the best too .
and james was hardly apologetic .
"yelp helped me find the place for a business meeting , everyone loved it ."
i also got veggies with it and even the veggies were delicious .

in my opinion this is n't always a good thing .

from the soup to the fries we were very impressed .
it turned out great !
"the staff is efficient , friendly , and knowledgeable ."
tsa agents are usually pretty friendly .
i later called panera and spoke with the manager dennis .

"after some people cleared out , i was able to get a little service ."

she had zero personality .
they 're usually seasonally themed and are always adorable .
"there were not many figures , and was not worth the money ."
the vegetables provided was obviously not fresh also .
"i grew up with animals , and our vets were never really caring doctors ."
the patty including the bun and everything else between is refreshingly ... fresh !

service was great .
"about an hour and a half later , i got sick ."
this is a family owned and operated business that truly knows their craft .

then we got meat and cooked it at our table .
they have the biggest honey crisp apples i 've ever seen !

they gave me a number to call to receive my refund .
the manager did n't even give a shit .
it 's quiet and the pool is always clean .
the inside of the place has not been cleaned in a long time .

nova 's is great if you get their fresh bread .
"keep the $ _num_ , y'all need it more than me !"
this is a truly great outfit .

the shrimp parmesan was literally boiled shrimp with seasoned canned tomato sauce and mozzarella .
came here twice and loving it .
"good service , we were seated quickly and it was busy ."
"i thought shrimp cocktail was served cold , not hot ."
this place was heaven when i was a kid .
i had a great time here !
you 're never too busy to tend to a paying customer .
in conclusion ... yea ... we 're not coming back .
worth it if you are n't too cautious though .
i literally could not eat the rice or the beans -- they tasted awful .
but not if you 're renting from hertz .

"needless to say , i left quite a bit on my plate ."
the baja shrimp and crab dip is delicious !
the customer service was also very lack luster .
the salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet .

when a person answers they are so rude .
"they seems very caring , and have always given good advice ."
she is a great asset to the company .
"yikes , this food was terrible ."

the last time i went in i needed a standard bass case .

"this place is pretty old , worn and nasty ."
this is one of my favorite places to just hang out with friends .
no worries about being followed because everyone is treated with respect .
it was so delicious i took a nap afterwards that was also glorious .
sat inside for ten minutes with no service .
"of course , i had to search again for someone to bring a bill ."
it 's really necessary since most of their orders are take aways .
i guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a friday .
best carolina bbq i have had .
she was appalling and rude .
"for her to say those things , it 's bad ."
"by default , only decent food is in bar restaurant ."
the girl who took care of coco was so sweet and gentle with her .
this place is jumping right at noon .
this particular fatburger did not make a great first impression on me .
"very nice and full of smiles , he recommended certain foods , certain drinks ."
this experience was horrible .
and the service is always on point !
"anyway , i would n't go if i was you !"
the desserts were over the top good and helped top off a great experience .
"the kobe burger , was alright , nothing special ."
"i know , i know ."
this included most of _num_ of my nails .
"the pasta i got was good , but nothing to write home about ."
a girlfriend and i went to this club on a sunday night .
service was on point and with a great sense of humor .
it truly felt like i was back home .
it 's definitely cheap and `` $ _num_ dollars worth '' .
thank you !
they came out good the second time around .
"if you do n't either , do n't go to this club ."
the service is always exceptional here !
it was obvious the person making it had not eaten fried rice before .
"but , i like the ones from crown bakery in chinatown much better ."
this situation happened _num_ times .
i love this pizza .
"finally , the parking here sucks ."
i also wore flip flops in the shower .
"not only delicious , but i 'm set for the day ."
which it had never done before .
we ordered the basil pesto and meat lovers .
it is totally worth it !
"could have been a beard hair , i dunno ."
there are way too many soccer posters .
she is very sweet and cares for my dog as well .
i had the lunch special beef fajitas and loved them .
very helpful and answered all my questions .
"they get busy at times , but still treat their customers right !"
this was also disappointing .
this place has a shuffleboard table and a nice dive bar ambiance .
i guess i will limit my shopping to frozen foods or smoking deals .
btw the cocktails are great also .
"the coffee 's good , but i definitely come for the food ."
i do n't know what kind of shit job they do .
always make you feel like they are glad to see you .
the shop rate is better than most .
"pad thai was delicious , some of the best i 've ever had !"
she brought me over to the sink and washed my hair .
"sorry , this one 's a bit harsh for me !"
i ate garbage .
"some things however , are unacceptable ."
the spinning salad is a joke - and nasty .
i ca n't believe that she did not comp .
the mess up and the way she talked to you .
"slow service , never brought my appetizer but tried to charge me for it ."
the staff is friendly and attentive !
everyone is nice .
my car is not worth that price .

the staff there is very friendly .

bread pudding was luke ward and mediocre at best .
the room stayed a constant _num_ degrees .
ive been a member here about _num_ years and have been to different locations .
but when i do it 's for special occasions !
"i like carl 's jr , that 's why i 'm giving two stars ."
is horrible .
this location gets _num_ stars out of _num_ stars .

i used to enjoy applebees and quite honestly i have no idea what happened .
the salad was nothing special .
totally reminds me of getting a slice in nyc .
some chick pea dish was ok but there was n't much of it .

the owners are super nice .
keith the owner is always very accommodating and his prices come in very reasonable .
i was rather disappointed in most aspects .

i wish i could give negative stars .
"my group thoroughly enjoyed all our dishes , especially the bacon wrapped dates !"
this time we had to hand over another $ _num_ .
i would give him a _num_ start rating .
they are very addictive ... .
this location is no different .
we did n't receive any fries until they brought our order .
the surroundings were beautiful !
i asked why there is a wait as nearly all the tables were open .
"they refunded me for the manicure , at least ."
restrooms are always clean .
absolutely the best onion rings that i 've ever had .
good was great .
"wait , better , because the kids actually got to do something and learn ."
"no surprise , but they refused to refund the `` rush fee . ''"
"overall , our first experience , was not so great ."
i love thai food ... and pink pepper has some very good thai food .
for the price food was n't that great either .
everything was very good .
"the cone is super good , and the strawberry ice cream is perfect !"
i was incredibly disappointed .
this restaurant is a master of understatement .
"thats just plain lazy , disrespectful , and does not pump anyone up ."
$ _num_ cover .
was truly a nightmare for me .
they greeted and welcomed my husband but not me ?
food & company are welcoming & great .
"it 's truly a great customer service experience , and good business practice !"

right then i knew they were liars and flat out dishonest .
this place is amazing !

the pizza was fantastic and the super simple dinner salad was soooo good !
wanted to try this restaurant at lunch time with the hubby while in vegas .
the dinner ( some kind of fish ) was salty .

the best crawfish touffe i had so far .
it was comparable to airplane food .

"the pizza was cheap and tasty , and best of all : hand tossed ."
when i see my burrito all it consisted of was literally beef and rice !
the restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a wednesday .

i could write a book on how bad this place is .
"omg , their cheese and onion enchiladas are superb !"

they do not care tenants at all .
i think the best way to describe the food is good old fashion american .

i did n't like this place at all .
is n't that the primary business ?
this time it was fried too long .

"plus they 're a local charlotte family chain , which i absolutely adore ."
he finished and handed me the mirror .
all the staff is very friendly !

the new shop is large and well set up .
"after a good wait , we find out breakfast ends at 11am ."

this place is run down and overpriced .
when i walked in i gave them my name and paid for my order .
this apartment community is horrific !
"this particular deli meat however , was a few steps beyond ."
just when you think it could n't get any worse !
the new location is much bigger and gorgeous !

the nurses are so sweet and kind .
i ordered the turkey and pesto sandwich .
been a regular customer since the day they opened !
gourmet wok used to be my favorite chinese restaurant .

( more than a month ago the item was received ) .
the food is fresh and delicious and staff is super friendly .
best tailor i 've found in the valley .

the pasta was warm but way over-cooked and was too soft to serve .
a favorite of mine since the first time a friend took me !
the service was more awkward than attentive .
went to visit with a deal saver coupon refused to accept .
the food was delicious .
either as a couple or as a group - this place works .
nothing to do with what they show online .
both were good .
but for the price $ _num_ you ca n't be that upset .
this is a very good pizza .
i enjoy eating inside because it is quiet and clean .
there is a stench that has no equal .
i am also a big fan of their coffee drinks .
the food was really really bad .
i was also not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant .
i was in heaven !
also the drinking water tastes great !
"a perfect , hearty breakfast served in a friendly atmosphere ."
it 's to far away and not worth the drive for slow mediocre service .
"they are rude , inappropriate and so unprofessional !"
salsa was homemade but lacked robust flavor .
the hush puppies are great !
and boy is it full of colorful stuff !
it also provided a bit of texture that i enjoyed .
that is just poor taste from a service stand point .
told us that it would be a _num_ minute wait .
"after finishing one , i ordered another it was so good ."
"thank you aj 's , you are the best !"
she was unable to readily diagnose my condition .
pissed me off .
paper skyscraper is a fantastic and fun store .
"as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food ."

it 's definitely americanized but it 's really good .
"in fact , i think their food is the best thai in town ."
i honestly love this place .
this place came up and sounded great !

"dessert came , was ate and still no box ."
their fried breakfast potatoes are so so good .
i ended up renting for _num_ days .
"they are n't kidding , the soup is phenomenal ."

"we went here on a late saturday night , approx ."
"i had an amazing experience at vera 's and with my consultant , kayla ."
"i got an adorable pair of shoes for $ _num_ , among other things ."
but from the moment they had my money - everything went down hill .
staff always helps .
the french fries are the best i have had anywhere .
i am sorry .
the only thing positive of this visit was that the beer was good .
its ridiculous and the policy needs to be changed asap .
"i mean , how do you screw up fries !"
appetizers were delicious .
"after _num_ visits , we are done ."
"at this point we were quite frustrated , because he treatment had not worked ."
the bathroom floor was not clean .
we ordered and our food was hot and amazing !
he was arrogant as well and spoke down to every patient .
"i drove a long way , so no need to come back ."
they also have plenty of tv 's if you want to enjoy the game .
i was neglected from this point forward .
the ac is not even adequate .
she is very attentive and our order is always correct .
the place was jammed up with patients ; way too many .
we are seated and wait for awhile for someone to take our orders .
finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast !
everyone here is very friendly and accommodating .
friendly staff and they are always on top of refills .
their beer selection is not very good .
this store has burned me for the last time .
the food was amazing !

which did not feel genuine .
nothing had taste .
we decided to go there and got great service .
"overall , i definitely recommend !"

service is awesome as well .
this place is absolutely amazing !
our must recent bad experience happened today .
rocco 's is the best !
food service is not acceptable .
we immediately stacked the plates with the steaks for removal .
"nothing special here , and i did n't eat it ."

the free breakfast was also exceptionally good .
this place has the best tacos al pastor in town .
"she was super friendly , and caring ."
reliable glass really deserves six stars !
food is delicious .
the staff is terrible .
i knew it and she knew it .
the pizza arrived faster than expected and was nice and hot .
this actually looks like some sort of bite !
will definitely eat here again when we 're in lv .
i am asking you !
thank you !
he was rude and ruined my desire for even wanting to go back .
it was ok.
the decor is awful !
the tree had been there for over two months prior to my purchase .
food is bland and severely lacks in taste and seasoning .
the food here is ... amazing !
i do not recommend this place .
pizza was never delivered .
getting on and off is confusing .
the service was fantastic as well .
"the staff is amazing , particularly the daytime nurses ."
went here for the first time and really enjoyed it .
does n't say much about the owners or management .
"the broth for the pho was really , really nice ."
i had a chicken burrito that was filled with bland rice and tasteless chicken .
would highly recommend if you 're willing to go into a hotel to eat .
we both loved it and the drinks as well .
the best part is how efficient they are at making your burrito .
"well , i have never seen a friendlier staff ."
it really hit the spot after a _num_ hour road trip !
they change up the taco specials daily and the taco shells are amazing !
the x-ray tech offered me two blankets .

the restaurant is clean but i 'm not really looking to return .
"it is just a small hole-in-the-wall type place , those are the best ."
i really liked their red sauce .
"even so , the service was adequate - nothing more , nothing less ."

the hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together .
the service i received yesterday was outstanding .
they do the job right .
"we loved jessie , our server !"
staff is very friendly as well .
not so much as a `` how do you do ? ''
"so , we sit down and assume that it will arrive any minute ."
john the owner is a great guy .
i 've enjoyed this movie theater every time i 've visited .
clear roof so a lot of natural light comes in during the day .

we had the signature aged steak medium rare and it was perfectly cooked .

this is a local family owned restaurant .
well it did but until 2am ?
food is delicious .
and i always crave this place after like a week of not going .
it 's worth the wait though .
the fried calamari is great and the pho very good .
a company should not have employees that scream at customers .
they are out dated and their customer `` service '' is non existent .
i highly recommend this office .

buffet was crap ( desserts were good ) .
"our server , ben , recommended the chicken pita , which was really good ."
i never understood party favors .

"the mashed potatoes & green beans were very good , as well ."
"they always make me feel very welcomed , which is fantastic !"
the server was rude to both my mother and i .
after that he was really slow with the food and never came with refills .
god knows what could have happened or how long he could have suffered .
i love this place !
worst place to be if you truly need help !
they made sure she was comfortable and cared for .
and did a great job on my car .
my family eats here after church most sundays & we love it !

this is a good place to go for a change of pace .
"but they always take good care of me , and my car ."
service was slow .
i 'm always impressed with the service and the food .

the quality of it all was fantastic .

"but the desserts , which look great , are awful ."

by far the best vet i have used in america .

this whole place is a scam designed to take your money .
i really like this place !

the pizza was mouth-watering and i really loved my veal parm sub .
my nephew paid $ _num_ and they gave him a _num_ day warranty .
"rude , slow and then they started talking about me in spanish ."
i would choose _num_ zero stars if that were an option .
gave this place another shot and just as horrible as the first time !
of course not ... lol i knew that was a waste of time .
my parents love their burgers .
my favorite is their ranch and caesar dressings !
the best part is that it 's free !
i am giving one star because there is no option for zero stars .
the pizza is god awful ... just do n't .
_num_ days later the gel is peeling off and my nails are breaking .
habib hemmed my wedding dress and i was very satisfied !
this gun shop deserves a rating of lol .
a great place to take friends that do not live in the area too .
michael the owner is great .
my experience was horrible .

"well , he found a place for the dogs and us !"
husband had the western bacon cheeseburger and said it was good .
well as far as gas stations go this one is pretty standard .
everyone that works there are always so helpful and nice .
but their classic club wrap and side salad are really good !
the manicure was the worst .
the hot dog bun was cooked to the point of being super crunchy ugh !
as good as it gets for comfort food !
"she 's nice but for the price we paid , we were so disappointed ."
that 's insane !
"unfortunately , it 's a totally unknown ( or ignored ) concept here ."
i asked the employee if this was normal and he said no .
she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable .
we went with a groupon and was treated like we were sub-par .
i just hate these sandwiches now .
i messed up ... i 'll grab them . ''
let alone that they wasted my entire day .
the chocolate chip cookie was fantastic .
what i received was such a disappointment .
both are great to snack on while drinking with friends .
the owner was sitting right there and did n't do anything or say anything .
she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .
these guys really care about their customers .
this is a really cute spot !
"my wife turned and stated , `` i 'm not staying here '' ."
"love this place , food was amazing and service was great ."
that is the biggest bull crap i have ever heard .
"they tried to get me in and out in _num_ minutes , like really ?"
the seafood gumbo was just meh .
"the service is always quick , easy and out the door ."
i did not see anything that would attract me there .
i am a fan of this place !
our family night was over the top .
both are great .
the only thing i really did like was my view .
my question to them is what the hell do they actually inspect ?
and they know what a fuzzy screw is !
definitely found a regular .
it 's always cheap place to shop .
also the biggest draw to this casino was their buffet .
i love this place .
food was great .
this place at first was upsetting .
the beef is so tender and the noodles are so buttery .
to some it may seem odd but adds to the charm .
this place is so busy and the staff is very very nice !
they deliver consistent great service that we can count on .
there is an atm at the credit union across the parking lot .
apparently they did not need our business .
service is good except you have to wait to order from the counter .
it has that old wisconsin feel to it !
it was so good .
the rolls are good not amazing and same with the nigiri and sashimi .
fast forward two weeks - i just returned from receiving my prepared tax documents .
thank all of you again !
this is the absolute worst outback .
the prices are great and the staff is very helpful .
either the food gets too hot or too cold .
they make good burgers .
these people actually run after you to get your attention !
the pre-made salads and meals are so fresh and out of this world delicious .
"the tv is great , always playing the news , which beats music ."
this is a strange little complex of stores that calls itself an outlet mall .
"i mean , smart automotive repair advice ."
it was fabulous !
"this is a family establishment , husband and wife team ."
food was great !
"but sadly , they have lost the art of making great food ."
"he was great , but sadly there were too many other things wrong ."
but it 's not persian .

"they give lemon , no lime ."
the bean burrito was ok but i had them add sour cream and guacamole .
and everything is maintained great .

it is authentic and i love it .

he was extraordinary !
this place is a gem !

the staff is always nice and friendly and you 're helped right away .
the woman at the desk knew i was upset and was annoyed by that .
the place was very nice & clean .
"the feel is comfortable , bright and clean ."
it 's pretty much what you 'd expect .
pricing is usually fine and the lines move quickly for entry .
the food was so burned we could not eat it .
the woman that was following me could 've asked !
i went into the store and was greeted by a really pushy sales lady .
"they also have a bison , which i love !"
the garlic ranch dressing is good on just about anything .
the waiter brought out wine glasses for the table .
breakfast food is consistently delicious .
one of the worst customer service experiences i 've ever had .
this company has to have the worst customer service in the world .
my husband walked in and ordered a large veggie with italian sausage .
"drinks are amazing , everything you can think of and more ."
i grant them an extra star for that !
they are the best !
"by the way , mike was our server - super knowledgeable and friendly !"
i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
the presentation was horrible .
this place is outstanding .
the guy at the front was a total jerk .
karaoke is fun and nobody cares if you sing good or not !
the service is probably the worst part .
the staff is fantastic !
amazing people work here .
absolutely loved my meal here .
my bf loved the pizza ( and the note ) .
we left full and satisfied on our way home to tempe !
the service was great and a smile on there face !

so i called for takeout breakfast .
i love these ladies .
this place really is a gem .

i really like their private line of grooming products .
"incredibly , this car is still on the original transmission and is going strong ."
the building itself is very very beautiful .

dr. a truly loves animals and it shows .
the rest of the staff is pretty cool too .

_num_ stars it is !
this is not the cleanest location but again just okay .
i was so impressed with their results .
i really enjoy the food here .

the office is relaxed but very professional .
being conveniently located he decided to try them and he liked them .
plus the location is horrible .
the tables are never clean .
"pale and tasteless , the burrito was very disappointing ."
the hotel staff really could n't care less how this property is run .
best fish taco i 've had outside of san diego .
the price is very reasonable .
it 's just an all around good place .
"head chef came over and chatted with us , what a nice treat ."
"all in all it was a bland experience , both times ."
it is what it is i guess .
sweet and sour pork is great .
stayed at the hotel for _num_ night .
i do n't even know where to start .
got a gift from my daughter that she purchased at worst buy .
the garlic knots were literally swimming in a pool of oil .
i definitely recommend this place .
"it was perfect , and i made the presentation on time ."
was so happy that they were open early on a sat .
i should of just hung up and made other plans for lunch .
the chef is fantastic !
the doc says no and he will not treat me until it 's paid .
especially with my order because it is unique .
"at that point , you are screwed unless you have another loan plan ."
the staff was very attentive and accommodating .
"the date of my visit was saturday , august 8th ."
i never had this shit experience before !
i said no and drove off .
fiori 's is the best .
"when we received our order of wings , they were cold ."
the grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area .
"lets talk about the entrance , which is vast in size and its gorgeous ."
he helps you know what to look for in a suit .
one of the most amazing places i have ever visited !
you have an excellent employee !
but all the staff are always warm .
i had an excellent experience !
they did n't even offer to cover my oil change .
katie is our favorite server .
"great food , chicken and gyros were fantastic !"
they 're extremely clean and really organized .
you truly stand by your name and your astounding customer service !
and the place was not even full of people .
do n't you want your script !
they also make sure the property was immaculate before they left each day !
the place was out of control .
great burgers the chilli is pretty darn good also .
what i did n't like was the burger was extremely salty .

do n't waste your time i wasted mine !
i called to complained but suddenly no one spoke english .
service was top notch .
problem i tell them to stay away from trail trans .
nothing has the same taste !
great airport ... travel out of it very often .
alot of the items is presented neat and fresh .
"she does n't treat you like patients , more like a sore thumb ."
the sauce was so-so .
definitely loved the service .
staff inside are a little slow .
it 's tasty and different from most other mexican joints .
"this time of day staff is trained , pleasant and ready to help ."
it 's amazing .
"great old school vegas feel , amazing service ."
the owner is great and she will help you find anything you want .
the veggies were wilted and watery .
knowing they are going to be honest with you makes all the difference .
i sat in silence as i watched el hub and friends play craps .
the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me .
a few days later my battery is completely dead .
"otherwise is a clean , well maintained zoo that the kids really enjoy ."
place is clean .
cashiers are so friendly & very polite .
best steak ( filet ) i 've had in some time .
this is real bar .
stopped at the pool bar before even sitting down .
the food is fantastic .
i have never heard that in my life !
the other bad reviews on this location are right on par with my complaint .
"plus , the guys who work here are super helpful !"
the wings of fire is probably the best tasting in town .
she did n't even ask if we wanted any appetizers or anything .
been here a few times and the food is consistently delicious .
everyone is happy about the dish .
we had a shrimp molcajete and it was delicious .
"the clinic is clean and friendly , and the staff is great ."
she said i still had to see a doctor .
it 's a great date spot .
"the burger was n't good or bad , it was just ok ."
"also , everything was cold ."
"get the bill , she charged me $ _num_ for the sour cream ."
she ate and we went to sleep the rest of that saturday .
"once we arrived , all the service was excellent ."
the staff were rude and unhelpful .
greg was an amazing teacher ... .
the prime rib dinner was a fantastic value !
"wonderful , fresh bun - thank you !"
_num_ other larger groups seat behind me .
looks like its more like _num_ to _num_ ratio .
it is disconnected .
wo n't be surprised if they show up on dirty dining .
unfortunately the magic stops right there .
needless to say it was n't ready .
"i had _num_ eggs , sausage , hash browns , and pancakes ."
i absolutely loved everything about it !
but it was worth it .
"texture , flavor & all around consistency was terrible ."
i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .
she was wonderful !
the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .
i highly recommend select auto body .
( there were only _num_ checks . )
bottom line there are better place to go .
eventually went with the mediterranean sandwich with purple slaw .
battista 's is a tremendous place to go for a large group dinner .
la grande orange grocery is always good to me .
no soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too .
the food was tasty too .
a winner if you are on the west side of madison .
they just lost a good customer .
in the food service industry you do not blame the customer .
i do now !
i also got to sample the watermelon sorbet .
she was wonderfully patient and we never felt any pressure to buy .
the taste of the french bread was terrible !
you can always tell a good restaurant by the crowds the place draws .
i ordered a beef pho and it tasted really good .
this is the worst ihop location i have ever been to .
he is in no way professional .
i could n't believe how bad the service was over the phone .
i 've never even had a highlight without two colors sitting on the tray .
just simply state `` we dont take reservations '' .
"smells nice , , clean and the work out room is awesome ."
beats a chain highway place for sure .
"good selection and good prices , especially considering that everything is organic and/or local ."
plus the carpet as filthy and staff was so rude .
the failure here is in fact not the barista .
after more than an hour our pie was delivered and it was ... horrible !
_num_ ) the dj sucks .
"they are fast , friendly and always have a smile ."
the 1/2 pound burger i had was fantastic .
the only thing on the menu i could order was a very greasy quesadilla .
so why did i just give this place a _num_ star rating ?
i do n't get all the wonderful reviews .
they are truly the best .
these things make it a great place to great some homework done .
none were ready .
its clean but kinda turned off with the customer service .
"ordered the chopped bbq , mac n cheese and yams ."
the service is always on point and the owners greeting is a nice touch !
the food is all good .
blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people !
stayed here in august .
it was one of the best brunch we 've ever had .
it 's the best .
food is horrible now .
"but then again , maybe i just do n't get it ."
i 've had such a positive experience here !
the staff is friendly and experienced .
they always do a good job .
the food here is always fantastic .
i found one that i liked at sun valley .
and the service was the best thanks to debbie .
and to assume that any foul language is from my end is ridiculous .
"drinks kept filled , food came reasonably quick , and a well mannered waitress ."
_num_ of the _num_ of us had to request new silverware .
i enjoyed my visit here .
not only is the pizza amazing but they also provide exceptional service !
if i ever go in i always get great service .

chances of going back are slim to none .
that 's worth an extra star right there !
i then received the worst paint job ever .

no one had the number for customer service or corporate .
why people keep coming back here is beyond me .
