the quality of food at this location is much more consistent than other locations .
this place leaves much to be desired .
this small but mighty location is newly laid out and beautiful .
"this is ridiculous , unprofessional and by far the worst hotel on the strip ."
he greets you and asks you if this was your first time eating here .
this place is perfect !
was too tired to care at that point so we stayed .
quite simply the best place for an omelet no matter how you spell it .
it is very kid friendly which is always a plus for me .
"cvs minute clinic dropped the ball , big time !"
"always clean , employees are well mannered ."
the only good thing was the service .
the quesadilla was one flour tortilla folded in half .
family owned shop with years of experience .
but i was able to find great items at good prices .
foot solution was not the solution .
the burrito was surprisingly small .
it is nice to have the convenience of online classes .
everyone there was friendly and just relaxing .
"love , love , love trader joe 's ."
everything was exceptional !
this is my regular nail place .
"very friendly staff , vet docs - everyone is super flexible , and accommodating ."
and the breakfast menu is great .

tammy is ridiculously nice .
pollo con queso was tasteless .
"the outside looks old , but the rush tower is absolutely luxurious !"
was a first timer at the buffet but it was good .
so far service is good .
the waitress sucked .
"so , it 's great for my health even !"
best gyro i 've had on campus .
oh this circus is lv ?
did n't want to make it right .
i thought that was very nice .
it 's not attached to my reservation .
he seemed annoyed half the time .
"the food is good , the service is very good and quick ."
"however , we were highly disappointed by the food ."
admission is way too expensive for this zoo .
they are also very friendly with great service .
we 've got quite a `` gem '' here in anthem with this establishment .
and that 's a rare thing today .
so we took our time and really enjoyed ourselves .
the wild boar quesadilla was amazing ... i wanted more !
"it was so loud , that it was hard to carry on a conversation ."
like most tire stores this one is n't any different .
"when i left , they charged $ _num_ per tire ."
"the food was delicious , especially the chicken and pizza !"
waited for _num_ minutes and finally got disgusted and walked out .
but the doctor forced me to get one to diagnose the issue .
i loved this zoo !
that is ridiculous and trust me it is not worth your buck here .
"seriously , this is the best place in arizona for breakfast ."
highly recommended them !
we stayed here with our children and this place was clean and comfortable .
the chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells .
shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $ _num_ .
beer selection is good .
sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them .
"however , i was disappointed when i went in to talk numbers ."
the owner was very nice and accommodating .
"the food was actually pretty good and i , at least , left satisfied ."
it 's the place you regret going to because you 're completely isolated .
i definitely reccomend them .
she offered an experience above and beyond the call of customer service .
i love this place .
glad i do n't have to shop here again .
went here to some good socks and man this store was bad .
both times he was sick when i picked him up .
spa i have is about _num_ years old .
"polish selection was good , atmosphere was pleasant and soothing , and clean !"
this was the most disappointing trip to the nail salon i 've ever had .
sometimes you just crave it .
service was great see manny for his excellent customer service and his perfect timing .
i love the idea that he puts everything in writing ahead of time .
i thought prices for alterations were expensive there but its way more here .
i come here often because i live very close .
the ambience is fun .
the prices are good and the service is quick .
their breakfast sandwich croissants are sooo good !
i know i do n't come here for the service cause it sucks .
their staff is extremely unprofessional .
they do it really well .
"the restaurant , while small , is very clean and welcoming ."
they were only going to give us $ _num_ for my car .

there is a drive through wedding area .

the food is consistently impressive .
first of all the salsa dip trays are a total joke .

the car wash itself was shabby at best .
it was a pleasure to shop here .
it went very slow ... at least _num_ minutes until i reached an agent .
"but i like it , definitely would recommend to a friend ."
"i asked for chile verde , hold on i asked the guy ."
one dog is _num_ and the other _num_ 1/2 years old .
it was incredible how terrible the bowl was .
this church 's chicken restaurant has been closed for over a year !
and the staff is super friendly .
the drs and support staff are the best .
we called a plumber and will get this installed next week .
"the food was not bad , but the restaurant was filthy !"
the only plus stars are for the clean restrooms and the fried rice .
salads are excellent .
"obviously , i do n't enjoy coming here ."
"we walked in , no greeting , sat down and waited for a menu ."
"i have eaten chinese in hawaii , japan and california ."
"second , he was extremely condescending and said i bought the wrong size band ."
employees got bad attitudes & not helpful at all .
"the price was reasonable , atmosphere and location good ."
sure there are things that you order ( furniture lighting etc ) .
you are the last location and hope you guys open more back up .
i guess people have no taste buds !
the stew was hearty tasting and was really satisfying .
lighting is amazing .
"drive-thru is always good paced , ."
staying here ruined my entire vegas experience .
"if this had been our first visit , it would be our last ."
and the prices were extremely high for that low grade quality .
my order was taken very quickly and the staff was very friendly and helpful .
plates were dirty and so were the glasses and utensils .
being from nyc i 'm very biased when it comes to chinese food .
i came here on the recommendation of all of the reviews here on yelp .
thank you for existing .
they took them away and were rude and sarcastic the whole time .
not to mention the way i felt after leaving .
"their meat is nicely marinated , their steamed egg is just delicious ."
"however , this company is very shady ."
"when the bill come , it was a little more expensive than i thought ."
$ _num_ in tux rentals and we have to ask to have them steamed !
it 's a great cause and the stuff is good .
because they usually charge $ _num_ and it is high season in scottsdale .
you will crave this place every time you set foot in pittsburg .
i am extremely disappointed !
it 's been our favorite hotel until today .
ordered to go lady was really nice over the phone .
as long as my stuff comes back pressed and clean im pretty pleased .
"even with all the construction going on , traffic moved along quite smoothly ."

our bartender was a riot .
food is mediocre at best !
"the staff is polite , courteous , and great at what they do ."
i went back about 10pm and got another one i liked it so much .
the teller was inefficient and unprofessional .
"i enjoyed living there , and the office staff was always professional and kind !"

"rooms not ready , manager rude and did not offer any sort of concession ."
the hotel rooms were clean and comfortable .
it 's close to home and delicious .
the interior is more upscale than the other locations .
it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .
not marriott standards ... or maybe it is .
i got the john wayne with hot sauce and it was amazing !

she rushed through my pedicure and was looking away most of the time .
they were clearly `` warmed '' over in the microwave .
she is pleasant and listened to how i wanted my hair cut .

definitely worth trying if you 've never flown them before .
their drive through for the most part runs like a well oiled machine .
but the meal was over priced and not good .
the food here is great .
their teriyaki chicken is perfection .
the atmosphere is good too .

the food is always fresh .
the rooms are clean and the staff maintains it all the time .
"it 's not an expensive place , but the food is really so-so ."

this del taco is n't in the best place of town .
this `` business '' is trash .

the staff is always welcoming and the food is awesome .
there 's just too many other options now to continue to be underwhelmed .

this is my favorite place for lunch and for dinner .
i do n't pay for a pedicure just i get nail polish put on .

the atmosphere is great .
"had great service tonight , ask for lori ."
"you can see his picture on the wall , it 's crazy !"
"she was very unprofessional , chewing gum the whole time ."
the waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations .
the staff is all great and i 've become friends with several of them .
i had the chicken sausage scramble and it was excellent .
for the quality of the food the whole menu is horribly overpriced .
the entire menu is great .
it 's two or three years later and i still remember the horror .
"poor service , screwed up orders ."
"they 're tasty , light dumplings in a tasty tomato sauce ."
the brisket stays moist even until the next morning !
"every time we go the services is good , but the food is fantastic ."
this place is the best !

my husband and i enjoyed a `` staycation '' here for my birthday .
her nurse made me feel welcome and comfortable .
found the lock nut and did an awesome job .

"with solid leadership like brian , my faith has been restored in your company ."

i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .
there 's something for everyone to do and this is in my neighborhood .
the lady felt bad and handed me a $ _num_ card .
it was worse than bar food .
the only decent part were the chips and salsa .
she is rude and never smiles .
the staff was great !
the mc had the most ear piercing voice and even worse singing voice .
there was literally no one else in the store .
"my husband & i , went here for lunch ."
the owner is friendly and truly cares about his product .
this place is horrible !
thank you !
the decor is nice .
i wanted so badly to love this place .
customer service manager asks what the problem is .
"not much in the outside , but the food was very good ."
i am so disappointed !

spinato 's is by far our favorite pizza !
everything they offer can be purchased online and in some cases babies r us .

the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .
i recommend getting a reservation and treating yourself to a classy night out .
i eat here all the time .
i highly recommend posters mostly !
"however , it took _num_ minutes to get our food ."
so the rooms are nice and spacious .
it was not crowded at all .
this place is awesome !
we always go non chain and love this local joint .
this is a great combination in my book !

"i told the manager , please seat me on your patio ."
he did a good job keeping up with a full house .
i love this place .

al does some seriously good fish - get ya sum !
this is food that just makes you feel good .
"the wait was long , probably an hour for the first order of rolls ."
the server was nice enough to give us a free vip after dinner cocktail .

the food was extremely cold and way over priced for the quality of food .
"this mediocre , at best , restaurant has closed ."
he is quick to respond and gets the job done right the first time !
our drinks ran dry and the service was terrible .
prices are so high that i 've never once considered buying anything .
they have a huge cigar humidor as well .
"she did an outside wedding , it was very nice and cozy ."
mike 's show repair is a beautiful and a welcoming place .
i do n't like how they do n't show the prices on the menu .
love this store ... everyone is so helpful and knowledgeable .
love love love this church ... ... .
i also really enjoyed the chicken & cabbage soup that came with the entree .
the entire bottom was covered in oil and grease .
but this is the slowest moving starbucks i have ever been to .
love all the little treats they leave in the rooms as well .
the cheapest and best meal i 've had yet .
presentation was also bad .
the in house made granola was tasty and staff very friendly .

there 's no security .
chicken was pretty good .
their listed hours mean nothing !
personally i love this restaurant .

"the casino was basically empty , as was the food court ."
employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off .
this is a well organized big lots .
the restaurant was very clean and the staff was very nice .
the service was fast & friendly .

it looks like i am going to be taking my business elsewhere .

we have stayed here before .
the doctor i saw was rude and nasty .

"actual beans , made by hand i am sure ."
"with that out of the way , i absolutely adore chevy 's ."
but the food is worth it .

i love it when i can take the drive and stop by at kona .
this nail shop is horrible .
the _num_ is also fantastic .
every single time you come here they mess up your order .
every one of them was more realistic then the next .
who would stick up for an employee that was yelling at another paying customer .
"went there today , and enjoyed a great lunch ."
"surprisingly , this place was very very good ."
the pizza was so flavorful and simply delicious !
i really do enjoy this location and miss having it closer to our home .

these guys are rude and do not care .

"nothing stood out , nothing was horrible ."
we almost walked out and went elsewhere .
crust is chewy and airy .
i am so impressed !
good prices and staff is very knowledgable .
the food was not good and very expensive .
if my rolls looked like how theirs looked then i might consider going back.

it is a really cool attraction is pittsburgh .
my advice is to avoid this store .
it seems like they are hurry to let u done .
"do not , i repeat do not give them your credit card ."
the food is n't too bad for bar food .
this college is the reason young people are turned off towards going to college .
are you kidding ?
wine selection great -- reasonably priced and our pinot noir was delicious .
the staff is very friendly and knowledgable about all of supplements they carry .
"do i get a discount for inconvenience , absolutely not !"
the secret is the ingredients -- so fresh and of such high quality .
this was so disappointing .
i love the waffle house !
dont think ill be returning here unless desperate for a room .
the actual flight was just alright .

rushed me out of the restaurant within _num_ minutes of me sitting down .
and followed up with `` why would n't you pay for this ? ''
my sausage was cold too .
it 's small and bright and always a great visit for me .
it also has a great little neighborhood bar in the back of the restaurant .
it 's delicious .
and add another two dollars if you want chicken on that already pricey salad .
charlotte does not have decent chinese restaurant or dim sum restaurant .
their exceptional service every time is above and beyond !

it also just tasted like bar food .
bartenders are just as nice !
: ) i absolutely love this place !
so glad rosati 's is out here in las vegas .
abc is our favorite convenience store when we come to vegas .
our server was perfectly attentive .

this is what i get for letting other people book my hotel reservation .
"i 've had the salmon , completely under seasoned , overcooked and dry ."
i love the mix and match the flavors .
but even that was not comfortable .
salad or italian coleslaw was offered with both meals .
"this was the best experience possible , from start to end ."
"the atmosphere was perfect , with great live music ."
was also spilled all down the side of the glass .
i also quite enjoyed the beautiful pieces in the asian art collection .

i was so disappointed in this .
it did n't surprise me .
"it 's a larger airport , but easy to navigate with signs ."
i am a big salad eater so this place is perfect !
the service is good too .
"the basics ( orange chicken , beef and broccoli ) were okay ."
i 've tried several different menu items and all of them were excellent .
they will special order something for you if you need it .
well decided to wait ten minutes i said to myself would hurt .
the instructors are awesome !
the management needs to start training better here .
he truly made things easy and enjoyable for us .
macayo 's has great food but a poor happy hour .
i would rate this worse than a star if that was possible .
booked a room a few weeks in advance of our trip through expedia .

i truly enjoy this restaurant and visit it whenever i go to los vegas .
i 'm forced to give this place one star .
one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .
owner was friendly and the food was great .
i do not recommend them !
the main lobby had _num_ other guests in front of us .

probably the best service tech i have encountered in years .
this had been a horrible experience .

when i return to lv i will definitely go back .

chips are always fresh .
does this location not have open & closing hours ?
i will most definitely be back and i 'm telling everyone i know .
service was non-existent so we were ignored .
this place has always been bad and it will never get better .
although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium .

"most importantly , honest as the day is long ."
"nice place , martin was a great waiter , good food , good atmosphere ."
the products are very fresh and priced lower than the large grocery stores .
thank you craig i really appreciate you .
i can see why they have so many good reviews .
desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .
water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
and the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much .
ellis island is great for a good meal at a great value .
i felt comfortable going in there .
thank you to the wonderful staff at schumacher .

"this was like eating bread dipped in ketchup and olives , flavorless and boring ."

the spicy sauce was bland and did n't have the slightest kick to it .
we thought the food was excellent .
so happy a neighbor recommended them to me .

the service is also poor .
yes i know this was on food network but it is well deserved .

my mac n cheese was good and my steak even better .
the fajitas were delicious !
she is pleasant to talk with also .

the scrambled eggs were undercooked and cold .
the best thing about this place is their beer selection .
it 's not even summer yet .

both were rubbery and fake tasting .
the stable grill is now one of my madison favorites .
parking and the tram to each terminal is easy to navigate and very timely .
he told me it would be $ _num_ .

the bill was twice was it was for the other exact same repair .
the beer is what is special about big dogs !

this place is perfect to line your tummy after a night of drinking .
this qt is hopping !
they came back to our table several times to make sure everything was perfect .

loved decor and entire feel of the restaurant .
he has done amazing things for both of them .
"the salsa in general needs more garlic and cilantro , in my opinion ."
"but again , the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor ."
the food is good and totally authentic .
dropped in with my kids last weekend !
the job they did was mediocre at best to top it off .
"we brought the kids , _num_ and _num_ ."
i 'm still waiting to find out what ate me up !
$ _num_ wasted .
the bartenders are friendly and the atmosphere is great .
the only good thing they have going for them are their chips .
the hostess and staff are professional and accommodating .
waiting in line for the latest and greatest iphone is not worth it .
i am pissed .
everything was delicious .
the service completely sucked !
this place deserves ten stars .
"always crowd , but fast ."
they make it very easy to register online and make it fun .
the staff were warm and welcoming .
i particularly enjoyed the salmon .
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
"this included chips , drinks , and utensils ."
the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
all signs that the place is generally not maintained .
the pool area is nicely maintained as well .
that 's a lot of food for a fantastic price .
it was awful for a supposed upscale joint .
her work is impeccable .
i think it is unique with decent food !
the food is great and the prices are great .

i even talked to a supervisor .
the sides are great .

today is one of my highlights of bad service .
the waiter was basically throwing our food on the table no personality at all .
i love this little center !

the quality of sushi is fabulous !

a buffalo ny inspired bar conveniently located within walking distance from my apartment .

the cooks and staff are always accommodating and friendly .
best macaroni salad i 've ever had and love the cooked cabbage .
food is inconsistent at this location .
they make awesome local hawaii food !
"they have sandwiches , burgers , and more delicious offerings ."
i did not eat all and just had my lemonade .

"maybe , if it was _num_ ."
fu 's is awesome !
the atmosphere is cozy and warm .
also i was pleased with the quality of the work and the value .
these guys do it quite well .
i do n't want to `` like '' anything .
the overall experience was mediocre at best .
nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh .
the service is reliable and friendly .
i do n't even know where to start .
we went to our first panthers game here last weekend and loved the stadium .
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
the flour tortillas are homemade and delicious !
i love this place !
"he was professional , polite , patient and answered our questions with ease ."
i went there for lunch with my wife and the food was amazing !
the huge disappointment came when the pizza arrived .
this place is awesome !
we were very pleasantly surprised !
sandwich made perfectly and the store was big and very clean .
"first of all , that 's rude !"
"very friendly and sweet , and she does an amazing job ."
one of the best chinese food places i found to eat .
gun fight was fun also .
the food has always been excellent !
the food is horrible and does not fit with any type of dietary needs .
for a dinner that cost more than $ _num_ -- i certainly expected more .
"our rolls were okay , i would never go here again !"
thank you to the whole staff for going above and beyond .
"my family , friends and i rolled in and it was awesome ."
it 's a beautiful complex .
great music playing and the ambience was chill .
food is always consistently very good .
it was nice to see some familiar faces from _num_ .
it 's definitely enough for two normal size eaters to share .

he spent $ _num_ dollars on two chicken fingers meals !
they refused to fix it .

three minutes later someone walked out with our order .
"very sweet , and it was a pleasure to go there !"

she spent maybe _num_ minutes with me and left .

"oh , he 's wonderful !"
their new remodeled salon is gorgeous !
there was no hint of pink on the patties .
this is a little gem of a place .
the decor was semi fancy and the service was brilliant .
i learned a lot which made it easy to pick which bed to buy .
it was clearly not cleaned .
i held a corporate event here this week - cocktail reception .
inside it just smelled fried .
i feel that is very inappropriate .

my husband and i had a great time here .
we really like taking our dog here .
the reason for the low rating is the actual cars .
the shrimp sauce is really good .
egg rolls were very good .
"mongolian beef was slightly sweet , but that was basically the only seasoning ."
but there are still a bunch of shoe stores .
new to town so i was looking for a new local comic shop .
the service was great .
"i mean , when are n't you in need of beer i ask ?"
"the drinks are also huge and definitely worth trying , especially the peach one ."

they always have a good number of staff there always keep your drink full .
they know their stuff and will steer you in the right direction .
we booked a covered parking spot online and printed our reservation .
the server was very helpful and attentive .
"every time i 've gone , the coffee is perfect ."
the eggs benedict my wife ordered were ordinary at best .
i recommend this the next time you visit the strip .
the check out line was _num_ deep with one person doing check outs .
the atmosphere was relaxed and calm and i would definitely recommend this place .

she did not enjoy her dinner .
the wings sucked .
service was horrible .
they r wonderful .
"every time we go , at least one item is missing ."

simply the best pet grooming experience i 've ever had .
the sushi it self is just ok .
the service is also pretty fast and the staff is very nice .
customer service is awesome when autumn is working the bar .
okay that explains the _num_ week turnaround time .

dr. monica is fabulous .
hubby has traveled all over the country and loves hot dogs .
they just get it perfect every time .
"for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi ."
"it is off the strip , about a _num_ minute drive ."
edit : _num_ star now : so last week my vehicle battery died .
for one of the worst meals i have had there in years .
the employees at this facility are beyond rude and unhelpful .
it 's been one ridiculous thing after the other .
and management did nothing to help .
the staff is very helpful and i love petting their shop cats .
"this place is dirt cheap , and that 's the joke ."
food came out on hot plates but it was cold .
one of those things that it 's so close you never go .
the kind that falls apart when dipped in the au jus and no flavor .
excellent food this place is always busy .
"yes , it 's that dang good !"
it was $ _num_ per plate and served with a raw cabbage .

"however , the service is phenomenal ."
she recommended an arrangement for me and was prompt with delivery !
the internet was crazy expensive at _num_ per day .
i pass through mccarran a few times every year .
but it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent .
everything was super delicious !
"service was excellent , food out shortly after we received our drinks ."
the one lady who told us our car was ready was rude !
this is not one of them .
"if you did n't stop reading my review after that last statement , thanks ."
"however , their sub-par service is the reason why i never go there anymore ."
the blue fin tuna is my favorite .
arrived early and was able to still check-in .
it was n't even super busy .
i asked for them to be crispy and they were perfect !
shrimp friend rice was edible but not the next day .
the wait staff is always friendly and even remember me most of the time .
the food was very tasty .
the staff is super friendly .
the fried noodles with chicken is supposed to be like a yakisoba .
cheese tasted a bit off and my wife did not eat her tostada .
everything is worth a look inside of this theater .
they did not have enough staff for weekend dinner rush .
i did n't receive _num_ smile from this lady .

it is clean and the bar staff has always been friendly .
came here for an oil change on the weekend and an inspection .
"your customer service and managers are rude , rude , and rude ."
any the food is great !
"once inside , the environment is quirky and eclectic ."
my favorite is the sweet potato fries and not every place offers those .
they specialize in showing some of the best independent and international films in theater .
the bathrooms are still disgusting .
everyone is always accommodating and polite .
and their sauce is beyond delicious .
our waitress and hostess were also very pleasant .
the golden gate is a rip off .
it is a little pricey but well worth it .
it was great .
"prices are completely fair , wine and beer selection is great ."
"right on state street , and up top they have outdoor seating ."
i love kohl 's .
i appreciate that kind of service .
i only saw one full cart the whole time .
this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
i definitely recommend this place .
we have had our pool for _num_ years and love it .
tina was amazing !
i ordered the pan pizza little to no sauce on it .
this is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in .
alternative tan is a gem .
overall i am extremely disappointed with the customer service provided by the team .
the flavor of the beef and chicken shawarma was magical .
i went here last night and my experience was awful .
their food is good .
i run several companies and have never run into to this .
they are incompetent with their jobs .
the pizza is not overly greasy and the sauce is delicious !
i do n't see how they can live with themselves serving those plates .
"it 's a chain , so the food is pretty standard ."
thank you so much for going the extra mile .
i love how its just a relaxing environment and the staff are super nice !
the nice young man who helped me a buy a tree was awesome .

it 's an adventure staying here .
their filet mignon is amazing !
i love the marquee .
"this was an excellent smog check experience , all seven minutes of it !"
we tried it and it was n't good either .
waste of money and no one was happy with their meal .
this is very late at night already .
food was terrible .
i would not stay here again unless it was free .
had to go to the bathroom and that was a mistake .
that is n't an option on my mac .
"the manager came and chatted with us for a bit , too ."
i 've even got my father coming to the harris for bacon night .
after ten minutes my waitress returned and informed me they could do egg whites .
that last move turned out to be a big mistake .
the calamari was too large and rubbery .
the food selection is good .
the trails are in great condition and the views are spectacular .
they were helpful and friendly .
coming to aj 's is always pleasant .
i did n't eat here .
there 's nothing really wrong with it .

we are n't coming back .
service was seriously that bad for the money spent ... .
it stayed _num_ and above in the room .
this place is rude and slow as hell .
it was an overall bad experience here .
the people are pleasant and the atmosphere is awesome !
she quickly did my toes and nails .
after i moved out the office sent me to collections with no warning .
we really like this place !
"every single one of them was stale , barely edible ."
it is not accurate to report this as closed .
it 's crappy .
it was ridiculous !
"the staff is friendly , helpful , and efficient ."
if you are like me and live close by ... lucky you !
the presence of a television nearly ruins the otherwise perfect environment .
i made sure to tell the manager how perfect it all was .
nothing special tasting about anything served here either .
best food i 've had in c-u thus far .
best sushi i 've had in vegas so far .
love love love it !

"i heart you , best western madison ."

i wish i could say the service made everything better but it did n't .
i love the decor at this restaurant !
this review is solely based off of the pretentious atmosphere .
surprisingly more fun than i expected !
i love this store .
i highly reccomend .
the craftsmanship is outstanding and it shows when you get your vehicle back .
we were surprised that our items sold quickly and for a pretty good return !
food was good .
cheap and basic are no longer good enough for las vegas hotels .
apparently the party of _num_ that ordered ahead of us completely overwhelmed them .
i am always happy with the result .

staff is very helpful and friendly .
"wow , the thai fried rice is so amazing here ."
the steak skewers are tremendous - perfectly seasoned .

i went in one night after dark and the counter was just abandoned .
staff is great and pictures are even better !
they have redeemed themselves in this visit .
they always help .
anthony m. was a superstar !
"also , tim the photographer was great ."
she has no professionalism .

other than that i highly recommend this store .
the customer service is fantastic .
good comfort food is what i go here for .
i just wanted to let you all know how horrible it was !
"the sauce is good too , light but with a good tomato flavor ."
this place is family owned and operated which is a good thing .
"i was a little irritated , but the dog did n't seem to care ."
i absolutely enjoy seeing her and her nurse .
this is laughable at best as i am very type a personality .
mike did an absolutely excellent job with my shoes .
"i ordered the lemongrass tofu , and asked for it extra crispy !"
typically grab a whole pie just cheese since the flavor is incredible .
"it was loud , but that made the atmosphere fun to me ."
"no , the weather is not their fault ."
food was good but service left something to be desired .
"i like the tokyo chicken , but the teriyaki is really good , too ."
"i order flowers quite often , and i would avoid this place again ."
both meals were served barely warm .
it was a good sized sandwich and the amount of meat was generous .
"vegas may be cheesy , but it 's better than this ."
this place combines unique ambiance with great food and drink .
and the food was so bad !
mexican food ai n't fancy food .
that 's too bad .
the dumplings come with plenty to share .
i will be using them again and highly recommend their services !
portions were decent but lacked taste .
no but this place is bad business and over priced .

the tea is the best .
"the first place received was breads , humus , olives , etc ."
the calamari was among the best i 've had .
it 's not working .
always a long line though so plan to take your time .
throw in some sake bombers and a good time was had by all .
downside was offered a free hour of personal training when i signed up .
"great location , affordable price and had a little snack store in the lobby ."
price was ok .
definitely coming back for more when i crave mexican food !
"the dressing room is cute , a couple bathrooms ."
i also ordered soup which came after i questioned where my soup was .
the entire staff i encountered were professional and enjoyable .
i picked up a package and got blood run off on my hands .
this place is a must see !
"pho is great , bun is great , great seafood ."
"we enjoy supporting this local , family owned business ."
so the super rude gold counter lady called over the supervisor .
the firefly fries are always a hit when we bring people here .
liberty market is one of our favorite spots .
they are so big and delicious .
ambience is very open and casual but somehow still pretty `` nice '' .
that was a lot of fun .
"sorry , but our pizza was cold ."
sky harbor international airport is the best international airport in arizona .
the ribs are over cooked .
i chose the beef tenderloin and my date chose the fish .

maybe this qualified for one star .
i had a mandarin mule that was okay but not great .
the honey black tea gave us a bad taste of old honey .
my main course was n't much better .
"while villa is in a new spot , the food has not changed ."
i really do n't like this buffet .

they have been my doctors office for _num_ years .
this was one of the best music stores that i 've visited in pittsburgh .
but overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason !
they boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane .
pretty disappointed that everything at this cvs is broken .
do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs .
apparently one is not there on the weekends .
love this place and i tell everyone about it !
chris is the man !
"finally he arrived , but it was _num_ minutes late ."

this is our third and final bad experience with this dental office .
"well she had a chip so , the chip stated i am her owner ."
it was just disgusting tasting .
employees are careless and annoying .
they are always clean when we come in too !
toppings were sparse ; it was not visually appealing and tasted bland .
"good prices , the entire staff is very friendly and a very inviting environment ."
"but , they had hours until they closed ."

"well , in this starbucks you get want you order and promptly ."
this is the best mexican food i 've ever tasted in las vegas .

went here for dinner last week and it was just meh .
we woke up to bed bug bites and bed bugs on our bed .
i found a few good jackets and for a good price .
if it were up to me this place would even get one star !
i was really embarrassed .
it has all the channels with any sport you like .
i returned after two years and knew something was wrong .
to begin my room was not properly stocked with soap and lotion upon arrival .
the petite asian server is the best .
jennifer was our very entertaining server .
and just walked off .
"was not busy , the counter person just flat out ignored my request ."
there really was n't a massage .
first off it is a frozen tasteless pre-made patty .
elvis renewed our vows and it was amazing !
however we never actually stayed .
this was a great experience and i would so stay here again !
the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .
they are generous in the avocado which i like .
he is still not satisfied .
"entree we ordered crab cakes , a grass fed burger and mediterranean salad ."
i love soul food and they do great soul food here !
it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
i highly recommend checking this place out .

between her and her client that i rent from nothing is ever accomplished .
what can i say except for this is italian food done right !
this place is a tucked away little gem in the burgh .
juicy flavorful and the bun ( whole wheat ) is divine .
we live _num_ minutes away .

i had the best time at the beach !
this place probably has a delicious full menu .
so i waited hoping the atm would figure out i was done .
the staff is very accommodating and friendly .

not even the hot chocolate won the approval of my children .
location is perfect .
the beers are all pretty good .
"service is quick , efficient , and very friendly ."
"i declined desert , as the deserts were probably crap too ."
brought our dog here .
we had _num_ cheeseburgers with everything on them except bacon .
it was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day .
fish never taste fresh and this is a fact based on _num_ visits .
"they do treat everyone equal , equally horrible ."
the rice was cooked perfectly but had nothing special to it .
they do things by the book and look out for your best interest .
love the new spaghetti squash side dish !
taste is so nasty !
surprisingly they were really quiet .
on top of all that the services was horrid .
the _num_ star is for an attempt at a restaurant .
the vehicle was also very nice and comfortable .
and they had the nerve to auto charge for the tips !
the service was superb .
the owners are so very sweet and extremely professional .
but the view was great we stayed on the 10th floor .
the bench was way too low for the table .
the chicken nachos were amazing !
"really , how do you guys have _num_ stars ?"
"for the most part , people are always friendly and helpful ."
cried when i got back cause it looked ridiculous .
the bad is the bathrooms .
the bed was comfortable along with the furniture .

then i noticed several more bugs crawling next to the bed .
wait time for treatment was reasonable .
"felt like i was back in jersey , without the good food ."
"women 's shoe department is , during this visit , appalling ."
the service was awful !
they have fantastic salads and sandwiches .
the tub drain did not work and could n't be a new issue .
my roll combo also suffered from a strange temperature issue .
i was n't even off the dealership yet when immediately turned around .
the staff is extremely friendly and helpful .
the experience itself was more than frustrating .
this location is crossed off my list .
every single one of them agree that it is not mexican at all .
the food was mediocre but the drinks were good .
"we will probably be back , but only after the menu offers better fare ."
the boy eddie that works there is so sweet and nice and cute .
it was a lot more interesting than i had anticipated .
"so , overall , i was very happy with service ."
there 's higher quality chinese for the same price .
yes it 's a lot of food assholes .
"other than that , though , most of the hotel staff were very friendly ."
their repair shop is also top notch .
"before we met with him , we talked to his associate ."
"really good food , however every time we go the service is terrible ."
still do n't have my daughter 's records .
"if you want a steak , go elsewhere ."
i am never going back .
i had a salad for lunch and it was fine .
i give it an a+ for sure !
my girlfriend and i came for our anniversary and had an amazing time .
not an employee says anything .
very rude and almost seemed as if he did n't speak english .
they are like family comfort food .
"no cheese , fat uncooked on bacon and a cold waffle ."
the food was pretty good .
i found everyone extremely helpful too .
the waitress was very polite and was checking on us pretty consistently : ) .
this place is a gem located about two blocks east of the strip .
"anyhow , this is the best gyros place in c-u area ."
the greek salad may be the best i 've ever had .
i have got to remember to stop going there .
no apology was offered for the long wait .
we stayed here for a friends wedding in madison this weekend .
customer service rep was also rude to my wife .
"well , thought wrong , did i ."
this is a great local fish store .
so they really do n't give a crap .
"it 's beautiful , accommodating , and again excellent customer service !"
i think this place is pretty great .
i recommend this location .
"hmm , i passed again ... for the third time now ."
i hate spending money on my car .
everything is very fresh .
it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies were n't even tasty .
there 's a small casino with a few tables and a mediocre restaurant .
we ordered take away for dinner .
ps ... fries are really good too !
"the place is clean , nice ambience , and very spacious ."
i always get good fast friendly services .
and the wynn is by far our favorite to date .
but the food was well worth the wait .
everyone from the receptionist to the stylist was extremely nice .
always great service and the food is fresh and flavorful .
it was so bland .
"since it 's a small albeit busy airport , parking is excellent ."
i was surprised how good the food was .
i ordered the margherita pizza and it was soggy and crust was terrible .
but this is not high praise .
the cashier was nice and not rude .
it was a terrible experience in every possible way .
they have no common sense what so ever .
beats chain restaurants hands-down .
"i love atmosphere here as well , very refreshing ."
i really like the sandwiches and the different options .
it 's so much fun and it 's free .
sink is a complete idiot .
no ones perfect !
the location is a bit out of the way but its worth it .
rather small selection but what we bought looked fresh and tasty .
the meats are chewy and the fries are greasy and usually burned .
"after lengthy wait , had to pay for cab ."
and they do have one of the best biscuit and gravy !
they folks that were serving us are very attentive and friendly .
for a _num_ dollar tab id expect better service !
our `` non smoking '' seemed like an ash tray .
i recommend them highly for their professional services .
i also love the deep fried beef tacos .
"we ordered , again , bruschetta and a deep dish pizza ."
this is not chicago style anything .
the spinach con queso is the best .
another plus is that they have thai tea with boba !
the dutch baby is insanely good with butter .
i wish i could give a negative star .
"everything looked old , dirty , and used ."
the vanilla ice cream was good .
this place is horrible .
really looked like they just wiped it off and returned it .
this small place is great .
chicken was bland no flavor .
if you are looking for real mexican food do n't waste your money here .
they also have a dip trio but they are very spicy !
"jodi is a character , just hilarious ."
makes me feel uncomfortable because i really want to be able to shop there .
the mesquite chicken smell draws you in from outside .
i have bought appliances here several times .
i tried to ask a question before ordering and he brushed me aside .
the drinks were poured with a heavy hand and tasted delicious .
when we finally realized courtney had forgotten to put our order in .
i like this place !
it 's a chain i should have known better .
"after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server ."
i had the chicken and shrimp meal and it was also delicious .
thank you dr. cooper for all you do .
the staff is so nice and caring .
"wasnt impressed this time cheese burger overcooked and dry , fries cold ."
terrible management lived there _num_ years the last year was the worst .
they charge whatever they feel like .
the staff is friendly and the space is comfortable .
the mild taste more like marinara and the hot was just bitter .
do n't expect friendly service but expect amazing food .
she was so good .
i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate .
i have probably rented from over a _num_ different hertz locations .
"but if you do go there , give craig the stink eye for us ."
thai basil has the best lunch specials !
"finally , i get across that i want the broccoli beef to go ."
i do not recommend this hotel and will not return .
i gave them my credit card and they said it was declined .
service was great .
this place is a true tempe treasure .
f this when we left for the airport we took the cab !
very nice selection of wines - had a great moderately priced bottle of cabernet .
this is one of my favorite west side eats !
"it 's an ok buffet , but nothing really stands out ."
loved the collard greens and coconut cake .
"except this time , t. had performance anxiety and failed me ."
i had the stromboli and it was burnt all the way through .
"has a bar feel too it , but a family restaurant atmosphere as well ."
my onion rings were thin and mostly crispy .
they told him it was no problem made sure it was available .
it was drenched in salt .
i love goldie 's !
i had a great experience .
i do n't plan to stay here again and neither should you .
the food is fantastic .
thank you dr. grant and your wonderful staff.
"we are white , and the others getting better service are hispanic ."
the breakfast burritos and carnitas are our favorites .
the price was very comparable to walk in nail salons in the area .
christina the bartender is the best .
every time has been excellent !
"i called yellow cab again , then she said there was no cab available ."
i recommend !
when ever i come to charlotte i 'll always eat here .
definitely will be staying here next time i come to vegas .
he always recommend us few things and we enjoy 'em all .
"everything is good but , my favorite is their salt & pepper calamari ."
i drove it for _num_ miles and it failed the smog check yet again .
most important she loved the flowers .
"i love , love , love greens !"
turns out i did need that ticket and it caused me to be late .
"service is always good , even when the wait staff is curt ."
which ill get to more in a minute .
the staff are great .
i loved loved loved everything i ate .
dropping off our car was even worse .
"however , the food was pretty bad ."
equipment is top of the line .
the bbq pork chow mein was n't horrible .
the administration does not care about customer royalty .
"_num_ minutes to an hour for a table , after _num_ at night ."
he kept our drinks flowing and our mouths happy .
i still have a terrible taste from it .
both arrived within _num_ minutes of ordering and they were both delicious .
and i 'm disappointed .
it 's big enough to share and deliciously light and fluffy .
we will be visiting here again on our next trip that is for sure !
he could have just waited a few minutes and then sold me a laptop .
the new owner made a huge difference .
this is the worst walgreens i have ever been to .
food was good and generous .
"the joke was on me though , for being such a sucker ."
"but so what , i like it ."
she 's a true dog lover and rock star .
has an italian vibe to it .
"our first experience , the service was ridiculously slow ."
after my _num_ year old and i made our weekly purchase .
too bad the food is so bad .
the fries were bland with no salt but still crunchy .
pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat .
she had the ahi tuna salad - which she said was delicious too !
food just was not that good .
i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .
i ordered a new york style thin crust pizza with pepperoni .
this is a cute family owned restaurant .
from shots to x-rays i highly recommend these guys !
this place is consistently good .
it looks like a spaghetti warehouse .
family owned .
great mexican food and is usually serviced fast .
i was a little skeptical about ordering anything .
flavors are not particularly memorable .
our first visit was memorable and enjoyable .
they have lost a customer .
the staff is always nice and the two room suites are very comfortable .
so he finally walked away .
i decided to try this since it was a full service wash .
everyone i bring here from out of town loves it .
i guess customers are no longer as important once they already purchase the vehicle .
everything was perfect about our meal !
this place was not helpful to say the least .
the bathroom tub was a mess however .
often live entertainment on a weekday or two and on weekends as well .
portions and quality went down quite a bit .
the sauce here is excellent .
"sure they go up to size _num_ , but even the _num_ is a ."
they used to provide whole pickles but not any more .
i liked this place a lot .
"this place is great , old fashioned diner ."
fried icecream was excellent .
this is not the customer service i am used to at starbucks .
"but , they do usually have deals such as _num_ $ for two ."
father 's day brunch for family of _num_ and service was great .
this place is always packed .
"food is good , consistent ."
he said i could leave my car overnight if i wanted to .
i feel comfortable sending all friends and family to team orthodontics .
"literally the wifi or cable is out every week , ridiculous !"
"i wo n't repeat what everyone said , food was delicious , service excellent ."
save yourself the hassle and skip this place .
the salads were crisp and the meal was hot and tasty .
the condiments are all sitting out and for some reason it bothers me .
do yourself a favor and take your car here .
"i 'm pretty big , and i only ate half of it ."
they did an amazing job with my gel manicure and on my pedicure .
i was not alone there were other shoppers demanding to see the manager .
long wait times for mediocre food that is bland with no taste .
the service was on the slower side but the waiter was pleasant .
"what a disappointment , the risotto balls were very bland and gummy ."
it is a great local spot .
they have a great selection and their customer service is superb !
our local friends treated us for a dinner which is why we came here .
"it was only _num_ $ , its not a lot of money ."
i left my purchases there along with another customer .
most food comes fast and cold which is pretty weird .
"so , in conclusion , either have insurance or your screwed ."
i did n't have enough water to wash down the dried chicken .
"shady area , even a security guard is walking the grounds ."
i loved the atmosphere .
went back for another visit with my in laws .
they also have the cheapest gas station in the area !
"but , my experience afterward really , really sucked ."
we found the best food - quality and value - at golf resorts .
"never let me down , the prices are definitely worth it ."
i have had the most horrible experience of my life dealing with this company .
this is one of my favorite thai places in pittsburgh .
i really just wanted to leave as soon as i ordered .
"when i found out that the place had been sold , i understood completely ."
i love this place .
the staff is super friendly and the food is good .
i like their greek foods and their burger and sandwich fare .
the sandwiches and salads are great too .
bars like this are why pittsburgh is a neat town .
do n't get the guy when you first walk in and chairs on left .
they have the best fries around .
what the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered .
i got the side salad with parmesan dressing and he the minestrone .
i was always confident they would repair the problem properly .
the service was excellent as well .
"friendly staff , clean and really enjoyed my lunch ."
"even in a styrofoam take out container , it 's delicious !"
"my chicken sandwich was n't anything to write home about , but edible ."
"all i can say thank you , thank you !"
was n't expensive for the type of food served .
thank you and i look forward to our return visits !
i actually forgot to order a diet coke and she got it for me .
i made a 10am appt for _num_ days later .
they changed us again and that _num_ group showed with a party of _num_ .
that is if i decide to come back and shop here again .
"it makes it a sweet , buttery dessert ."
service has really gone downhill in the last year .
full of vegetables & super tasty and love the spice !
even paying the bill there was a lack of customer appreciation .
the decor itself was plain and did n't stand out much .
the whole experience was pathetic and disappointing .
bill was more interested in telling me that he could not solve my problem .
this is a decent chain bar that almost feels like a local .
everything we ordered was so incredible !
it was a total waste of time .
embarrassed to walk out i gave it a try to see if any good .
we had a groupon and everything went smoothly .
we had a great server as well .
technicians have been there _num_ times in last _num_ weeks .
"so i was a bit nervous , i had a great experience ."
your food is made or grilled fresh to order like home cooked meal !
i love this firestone .
"their rolls are fantastic , always tasty and just the right size as well ."
now if they know anything it 's how to make good ranch .
all the employees were extremely rude and seemed to hate their jobs .
reservations are highly recommended .
pork verde was amazing !
we looked at travel reviews and saw this was one of the top picks .
the meats were awful and poor quality .
famous dave 's does have great bbq .
we just got stared down by everyone and the servers .
"servings were generous , and some of us ended up taking some food home ."
the chili sauce is good too .
# _num_ is my favorite !
food as always was excellent but waitress was beyond awful !
they said it would be done by _num_ .
i already knew that ... i 'm not an idiot lady !
the food : this is the reason for the low rating .
it was horrible .
i tried it anyways but was grossed out by bite # _num_ .
sweet tomatoes is a must when my mom 's in town visiting .
the service is inconsistent .
both owners are super cool and super helpful .
my father in law fell for it though and ordered an appetizer .
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
their customer service was great .
"we each ordered prime rib , with salad and baked potatoes ."
i guess it just made me think we really were in nyc .
"we arrived with a reservation tonight , a tuesday , it was packed !"
made the trek and ended up having some really tasty pizza .
i ordered the ayce catfish and can honestly say the fish was awful !
i alway enjoy this place .

but a half an hour wait was a little ridiculous .
"centrally located , standard hilton so figured we could n't go wrong ."
"it 's cheap , convenient to my house , and my friends like it ."
that was way back when they were good .
our appetizers came out and were huge onion rings and fried pickles .

i really liked this kind of help and attention .
just trying to save you trip and put them out of business .
and just drove by this place yesterday -- smelled wonderful .
"while it had a lot of lobster , it was completely bland ."
allowed us to enjoy our fabulous food with a better than usual wine !
my favorite is the veggie bowl - delicious !
everything was great .
i always come out with something from the salad bar and sushi !
it 's a regular lunch spot for me .
owners treat us like family .
this is my least favorite lunch stop i 've ever been to downtown .
this is a family owned business .
my veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot .
tonight i 'm trying the seafood enchilada and is really really good !
`` it 's on rainbow '' is a pretty lousy answer .
it was disappointing .
was very excited to finally come here but left disappointed .
i was called on saturday and they let me know that i was approved !
the macaroons are sooo good and i 'm very particular about my macaroons !
there is only one high chair and very rarely anywhere to sit .

servers are friendly and attentive .
after a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly $ _num_ .
"all tables are complaining , none of us would consider to come back ."
they also give you free miso soup which is always a plus .
i had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad .
i guess i like it because i still feel they offer excellent customer service .
a lot more modern than i thought .
i live in henderson nv where this restaurant is .
seafood is fresh and they have good micheladas .
all of the negative reviews do not surprise me .
some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard .
customer service was good .
sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying .
"the lunch crepes are great , and you can even build your own ."
celebrated mothers day here and they never disappoint .
we love love that there are two macy 's in this mall .
"they are functional , but this is so disappointing ."
this place is amazing !
"if you live in the area , ride your bike or walk !"
"gave me regular pasta , and insisted it was linguini ."
because of this one i our party had to leave before we ate .
our main chef is chef ray !
owners are nice and it is great for a group .
"i felt like they totally took advantage of me , being a young woman ."
i ate it just because i was hungry .
tonight though was the worst .
"i love , love , love them ."
they do very good work and i am always in and out quickly .
for the very first time the food was awful .
you rarely see such good service anywhere anymore .
it just did n't look appealing to be a wedding venue .
i was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time .
"the food very good , i had the filet mignon ."
they smell very clean and sweet when they come home .
this place is so cool !
for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .
other dishes are good and they are reasonably priced .
this restaurant is fantastic in every way !
this is a must see .
"hey , i get it ."
they do n't care about their customers .
it has a lot of character and great decorations .
it was n't crowded at 1pm .
i highly recommend them .
it was gross .
and it was worth it .
its hard to be a worst walmart but this one is up there .
do n't be surprised if half the complex is empty .
needless to say i was disappointed again !
i love this joint .
even the rice in the beef bowl is fantastic .
"they show up at almost _num_ , and bring diet pepsi !"
they said the owners would n't let them shut the store down .
this is definitely a five star operation !
they hire kids that do n't care much about the customers .
they do sell snacks and drinks during the show as well .
their vehicles are dirty and smelly .
"within a course of _num_ or so months , we returned _num_ times ."
but for the price it has great service and it 's extremely clean .
went here last week for lunch and it was mediocre .
the pocket pies had a really yummy filling & the crust was great .
the bacon is thick and flavorful .
my order was $ _num_ for two items and a soda .
employees seemed happy and nice .
those are worth the calories .
this is something every auto parts stores and home repair store can do .
service is just way too slow at that place .
he was so kind and willing to help someone in need .
there was a green n red salsa ... i liked the the red better .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
there 's nothing to see here .
every visit is an awesome time .
courier cafe is one of my favorite places in urbana !
turkey sandwich are great here and they make it super quickly .
i have had the pork egg food young also and it is equally delicious .
i left because of the fact that they were so rude .
"once in that room i saw a nurse , she was nice ."
"the waiters could use some common sense , but the food is amazing ."
"he is reliable , efficient , and his store has great prices ."
the french fries were tasteless and greasy .
salsa is amazing .
i got no issues with it !
chinese food tastes way better than the korean food in madison .
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
it is seriously the best salad i 've ever eaten .
prices were just as great !
which was confusing since we purchased the groupon for that specific location .
staff is very pleasant and unobtrusive .
i love it- some of the best slices in pgh !
any way i bought my tvs elsewhere that day but no theater seats .
it will be a long time before we visit this establishment again .
and every time i come here the service gets worse .
it 's obvious they 're professionals who know their trade and love their work .
"i have not tried the food , but the coffee is always really good ."
the smell of cigarettes is every where .
i really enjoyed myself .
the steaks came and were both overcooked .
odd crowd and wait staff seemed uninterested in our table .
this is a good place to waste your time looking for customer service .
this was my third time going to vegas .
the best mexican food that ever was !
no wonder they only have _num_ and a half stars .
i went two days in a row to bring back home with me !

the food was cold and bland .
we bring our children and they love the live music .

i picked up a great baby gift and several of their candles as well .
this place is awesome .
"nevertheless , the pork chop was just as bad ."
the salad was soggy too .
price are very reasonable .
no wonder the place is so dead all the time .
this store is dirty and unorganized with horrible selection .
they are all very friendly and professional .
i decided to give the place a second try after my last horrible experience .
always drop off at a great time when there was a needed time .
keep smiling and doing the same great job you do everyday !
not even close to my first diagnosis which was off the fucking charts .
chips served warm and are light and crispy .
food is n't good enough to exist in its own .
"they have the best happy hour , and service is awesome too ."
chips and salsa was not edible .
i just paid _num_ dollars for shit service and a bad steak .
make sure you check this place out !

"they have good food , and really good salsa ."
"it was shocking and frankly , insulting ."

service - service was very slow despite having sat at the sushi bar .
these guys are great .
the hot sauce was spicy with a hint of vinegar .
"however , it 's a bit pricey ."
my fiance for it arranged and picked up very quickly and it tasted amazing !
"love , love , love this bar ."

but after _num_ minutes i asked about my order .
the other $ _num_ was for yoga classes .

"food came out extremely quick , soon enough i 'd realize why ."
it 's just average to below average for what you pay .
they are the best !
the instructors and front desk staff are great .
"for my meal , i ordered pot roast ."
there was no flair and no charm .

they have a handful of other house cocktails that are pretty good as well .
the staff is very friendly and professional .

so why didnt you call to let me know that before i came in ?
i called their phone number and i got an answering machine .
"they have happy hour and , reverse happy hour seven days a week !"
but i am a little upset that they are thin and one broke already .
i rather enjoyed my experience here .
location : hotel was hard to find at first .
the drinks are always hot and the espresso is strong .
that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !
everything is always fresh .
calzones are excellent .
the atmosphere and staff are so authentic .
green was an amazing meal that i crave and i am not a vegetarian .

the ambience in all of the restaurants owned by this group are amazing .

drug deals out in the parking lot .
we love fresh wasabi ... they have a happy hour that starts at 2pm .
the salon is easy to get to and they go the extra mile .

i hate writing _num_ star reviews !
the atmosphere is quintessential .
maria is amazingly talented and even better company .
the gym was also clean and well maintained .
the boba is chewy as well !
my warning is be careful with this place .
the apartments are well priced for the area .
"the service was fantastic , the appetizers excellent and the drinks strong ."
it 's a great way to eat family style too .
i think nothing special .
the kitchen area as i was paying grossed me out .
long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again .
this is the best starbucks i have ever been to !
the bread they bring is really good too .
the whole family is having a great time together .
the food here is delicious .
his staff is very friendly and efficient .
this chain place lives up to its reputation .
staff was friendly and drinks were reasonable but nothing to rave about .
the staff is nothing to speak of .
my half rack of ribs were dry and burned with very low sauce amount .
family owned and operated !
i take my review back ... i went back and it was unforgettable .
"and the music was a trip down memory lane , ha !"
he said it was our fault and that most of the steak was eaten .
i am new to az and i am so happy i found this groomer .

he 's very nice and courteous .
"the everything bagel has just enough of , well , everything ."
"mind you we were very polite , never yelling , or being rude ."
the care was kind and caring .
but it 's not there yet .
i suggest you guys come here its a lot of fun .
customer service is above average compared to the majority of asian restaurants .
it explained why the rooms never felt cool even with the ac turned down .
this was not even the dinner rush !
the service was the worst i 've ever encountered .
bruschetta appetizer was nothing to be impressed by .
i sure do n't want to stay in a dirty room !
and the man was so rude .
it was like stepping back in time ... and not a good time .
unless you want food poisoning .
"family owned , always friendly and always accommodating ."
i believe that 's a sin to serve frozen fish for sushi .
"i had the shrimp , which were nice and broiled ."
the quality of the fish seemed worse than red lobster .
but everyone was horribly unfriendly .
the western special is one of our favorites .
it was greasy and most of the food was cold .
terrible value but the steaks were good .
nothing was even close to being good .
the female bartender always does a great job .
haji baba is has great middle east food .
have never had anything but a fantastic meal .
went for the first time yesterday and will definitely go again and again !
the best and they leave you alone to eat .
overall i feel like this place is way overpriced for mediocre food .
great service it has improved their service .
i love their enchiladas and sopapillas .
that guy is just incredible !
my family moved to henderson from the midwest in _num_ .
"all the rooms are suites , there huge and very nice ."

so it 's very irritating to have to wait so long for a deposit .
they deliver really fast ( and their dine in service is wonderful ) .
we had a meat lovers pizza and it was very tasty .
the calamari had no flavor at all .
i do n't get it .
"i was not only disappointed , but frustrated and angry ."
"liz , jessica and tara are the best bartenders ."
i drove from north las vegas to henderson and still no cold air .
this theater is always clean and has friendly staffs .
idk the food was just a huge mess .
so happy i found this place .
i know mexican food damn it .
on the inside it is beautiful .
he tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money .
they have some really beautiful ones for sale .
they have a decent happy hour .
i wish i could give this store _num_ stars .
we love it and they 've always been great to us !
there were no clear cut winners .
i received a gift certificate and decided to stop by .
"kinda hole in the wall sorta place , but it 's perfect !"
room was old an dated .
if this rating were based just on their efforts they would receive 4-5 stars .
we sat outside and the weather was pretty nice .
i went to this place twice on separate days .
"looks can be deceiving , and sams cafe is a classic example of that ."
loved it !
"we were then not followed up with by her , or even acknowledged again ."
i guess being a woman at that hour your fat wallet does n't matter .
as our food was being prepared another customer was eating our fries .
thank you all for making me feel so comfortable .
i love that part .
everything was well prepared and it was a great presentation .
this is one reason i no longer carry cash .
food is denny 's good and quick .
_num_ minutes later we got some service but that was questionable as well .

service was incredibly slow and lacked overall .
i 've stopped going to this poorly appointed coffee shop .
im never coming here again .
this was my first visit to roy 's and it was incredible !
just not what i consider a `` happening scene '' .
the other one is locked there is no handle on the door .
the tortillas were very obviously store bought ; they were served dry and hard .
"by the way , i waited _num_ hrs in the office for my appt ."
we were impressed with the selection .
check it out and make sure the kids wear their play clothes .
very limited menu and food was ok.
no one checked on us until we were done eating .
eggplant parmigiana was good but not excellent .
they have donuts and buns which are really fresh .
i travel a lot !
the hot tub was lukewarm .
do yourself a favor and make the trip .
"there are security guards located throughout the complex , making me feel safe ."
portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu .
"make a reservation , this place is always full ."
these are so beautiful that i will pass them down to my children !
"if you 're in the area , give it a try ."
the service is great and the food is delicious !
i could tell they did not warm up the noodles enough before cooking it .
she came and checked on my table once in _num_ minutes .
possible the worst restaurant i was ever in .
pittsburgh has many good steakhouses .
"but , locals rave about this place ."
this place has good food and great service .
because of you and your staff he is home and doing so amazing .
i have had a sub-par experience every time i have flown .
also the guy at the front desk is somewhat rude .
my corona was ok too .
the patio seating was fun because you can watch people go by .
it 's dried out and flavorless .
the guy was really cool though .
meat is a lil dry but good flavor over all .
"overall , really liked the food ."
super knowledgeable staff and is always helpful .
"what 's the bonus , it 's right across the street from the hospital ."
i now bring my own kids here and they love it too .

i had my _num_ year old with me and i 'm _num_ weeks pregnant .
place is great for all ages and all levels of skill .
"i highly recommend this place for an affordable , worthy car wash ."
it 's the best greasy spoon restaurant in the area .
"everytime i have tried eating here , i get sick ."
we love this place and have come back numerous times .
but the orange chicken was n't amazing like panda .
bingo isnt half bad either .
"well this is not only a good salon , it 's great !"
the chicken was dry and chewy .
"this is your typical courtyard , decorated about the same as all others ."
i love this place .
omg this place is a nightmare !
any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere .
she made us laugh the whole time .
i love their onion rings .
the waiting room is very clean and the office staff is helpful and friendly .

worst experience i 've had with lunch .
they are arrogant money hungry bitches .

our experience has been nothing but positive .

the boyfriend got free glasses !
my brother found a car online that he really wanted to check out .

leslie and staff are always friendly .
"great food , just about anything you want it , anyway you want it ."
the staff was very pleasant .

"the bathrooms are filthy , and toilets are often out of order ."
this office is great .
the staff said that there was not an appointment available for _num_ months .
"his cake donuts are good , great even but his raised donuts are magical ."
this place is a complete shit show .

it 's very clean and organized .
it 's the best ice cream place in town .
it took _num_ minutes to get the check after we asked .
steak is amazing .
the karaoke here is the best !
and i also loved the french toast !
their service is fast !
i 'm sorry but that 's unacceptable .
i am disappointed after tonight .
and they were not even filling .
this is my favorite baja fresh in the area .
they still taste good just really small now .
they made us wait _num_ minutes before taking our tables order .
i advised her the chicken wings had been cold when they brought them out .
my boyfriend and i also love the atmosphere - very cozy and romantic .
"first off , the elevators in the parking structure are seriously scary ."
will see how it goes next time .
"since they knew it was a special day , the service was spectacular ."
fries were not salted and were tasteless .
"this is the best rays , do n't let the others fool you ."
"very nice , talked about sports and everything ."
"the staff were so nice , friendly and helpful ."
"however , with all the sanitary issues we noticed , i 'm skeptical ."
our server was excellent and the sommelier was very helpful selecting our wine .
there is no reason for such excessive hold times .
"this is one of our go-to places for a quick , tasty meal ."
the southwest burger is simply amazing .
salads are the stars though sandwiches and baked goods are great too .
ordered a brownie for dessert that was blah with chocolate sauce that was cold .
everything was amazing .
everything is good here .
the birthday boy loved the cake .
"there are much , much better choices around pittsburgh for my tastes ."

"service was slow , just getting a drink was an effort ."
"to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants ."
staff is very knowledgeable and helpful .
she was good and was confident cutting my hair .
it 's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff ... nasty .

i was very happy to be back here today .
the fettuccine alfredo with chicken was so disappointing .
"great ice cream , great atmosphere - live country music while we were there ."
"as always , had another great experience , last night ."
the food hit the spot .
they are cheap office chairs and the dressing rooms and mirrors are dirty .
the food was very good .
if you want absolute rudeness and no customer service ... go here .
i absolutely love living here !
she made me very comfortable during our session .
my burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken .
both vets are very compassionate and truly care about their furry patients .
_num_ weeks ago i was in tucson and got a way nicer blizzard !
"dear sir , travel nurse here that all meals are paid for tax free ."
the rude lady basically hung up on me .
she was rude and so full of attitude when talking to me .
i strongly suggest not going to this practice .
our experience was horrible when we picked up our food !
great lunch specials served with salad or soup and egg roll .
the chicken was so dry i could not eat it .
"good service , reasonable prices and they stand behind their work ."
we love cafes and this is now one of our favorite little spots !
_num_ ) wireless internet is _num_ per device per room per day .

i definitely recommend this place to anyone on a budget !
i left there so frustrated and annoyed .
this medical center is a joke .
"the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues ."
i love this place .
well i definitely was not disappointed !
"it 's a small place , so there 's usually a wait ."
the driver actually told me i should get a cab .
this is the worst strip club i have ever been to .
"therefore , i do n't go into the unit very often ."
why would n't the salesman who told me this say so ?
people who overheard the conversation while in line were disgusted .
always fresh always good quality and the staff is on top .
the concept is just so olive garden .
i enjoyed everything here and would like to go back to try something else .
i love their milk teas !
great service and they are open late !
food was lukewarm at best by the time it arrived .
which was the best item out of the _num_ .

pueblo grande was why .
the service is just great .
one of the best breakfast burritos i 've had in az !
he let me know then that my total service bill would be $ _num_ .
you 've lost this customer .

the perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato .
it was simple and phenomenal .
"the manager was not helpful , just said `` sucks to be you '' ."
"with _num_ theaters , there 's usually a decent movie selection ."
i truly appreciate that .
third - the room is not horrible but it 's not great .
the phone call lasted all of _num_ seconds .
the egg rolls were eh .
at this point she said `` then i ca n't do anything '' .
alan in the service department is amazing !
my experience did n't blow me away but it was solid .
the ambience is nice and cozy and the service is sweet .
and justin at the front office is so sweet .
i 'm sure there is better mexican food to be found in casa grande .
so helped us with instructions to do ourselves .
"and for the record , my wife is indian ."
it was creamy and sweet .
"the nose was off , and so was the taste ."
we have encountered more horrible experiences with this company than better .
"however , i did not like our family picture so much ."
"great steakhouse , food and service were excellent ."
staff was very friendly .
this pizza hut is a joke .
"btw home depot , lowes did it ."
the green beans were way overpowered by the onions in them .
the chicken wings are always crispy and on point .
best mexican food i 've had in the east valley !
they have state of the art equipment and is skilled and efficient .
- the driver who picked us up was absolutely awful .
"the chicken was dry and flavorful , and the veggies were soggy ."
"so yeah , i ca n't recommend specific dishes because i like them all ."
"as far as la fitness clubs go , this one is my favorite ."
we found a new dr !
they made it very easy .
app arrives ... _num_ minutes ... .
and waited ... for _num_ minutes .
"for some reason , the bbq skewers were inedible ."
everything was bland and coated in oil .
love the fact that they sell boar 's head meat .
i 've stayed at _num_ star joints and never had so much trouble .
and it was very annoying !
i had chicken parmesan and it was the best !
this was very good as well .
do n't they know not to mess with a good thing .
the food was awful and the presentation was worse .
overall this place is great !
i moved to new river late last summer .
"it 's cheaper , but not if they loose all your stuff ."
everything here is made with love .
dare i say `` the best '' gyros of all time .
"i waited _num_ minutes , spoke to _num_ different employees and nobody did anything ."
they are honest and wo n't over charge you .
"if you read this review , please also read nathan 's comment below ."
great stuff ... reality show perhaps ?
"i 'll take hot pink , thank you ."
"sorry , i do not recommend this hotel ."
and the found was delicious !
the special carne asada tacos are delicious !
it is a small shop and you get very professional and friendly customer service .
"i had the super sicilian , bread was excellent and so was the toppings ."
and the root beer is made in-house and has an awesome vanilla flavor .
they forgot part of our order from tonight .
on top of that they charge hotel resort fee .
staff is friendly .
if you enjoy breakfast you will really love the food here .
i have n't even ordered .
you can tell they make it by hand everyday .
i really like embassy .
the quality and selection of the breakfast items were less than desirable .
the only saving grace and reason for the _num_ stars was the milkshake .
it sucks .
finally got all the new flavors of tea .
"instead , us airways charged me a 2nd time for my ticket home ."
the parking structure is difficult to access .
are you kidding me ?
i 've always had such great experiences with them .
it was great .
all the dishes were very flavorful !
needless to say i was confused and very angry .
this alley is the worst alley ever .
it 's completely empty and nobody is answering the phone or emails either .
the pizza never got here - ordered hours ago .
this was my first visit to this specific location .
"but hey , if they screw up your order they give you free cookies ."
their fresh handmade pita is the best !
if the food is bad i 'll write another review .
that was pretty cool .
the food came out fast and hot .
overall the _num_ stars is due to the horrible service received .
we loved it from the moment we stepped in to when we left .
"everything tasted fine , it was just `` off '' ."
the black and white cookie is great also !
came here for happy hour .
everything was pretty mediocre .
it was very good !
the food was good and i would go back .
and they refused to give me any money back .
everyone i talked with was friendly and helpful .
i also love their beer selection and their full bar .
"when they 're hot , there is just something magical about them ."
and this one definitely stands above .
"but , needless to say , i was happy and grateful ."
finally got to try this place !
this place is horrible !
short version : by far the worst home depot i have ever been to .
my family and i love coming to rosita 's .
the food is great .
so their service is terrible .
the drink and dessert menus are also very good .
"our waiter was patient , helpful , and just had great customer service ."
i hope the restaurant management is aware of what a gem she is .
also : the parking garage has the best acoustics ever .
i kindly denied the x-rays .
food is very nice of here .
my wife and i love this place !
really disappointed as i live only a block away .
they did n't even bother try to work with you .
we were really really disappointed .
the service is great and the staff is on top of it .
it is clean and there are alot of changes happening .
these guys are great !
everything is always delicious and the staff is wonderful .
the kids meal even comes with an ice cream sundae .
"from the second i reached the front desk , my experience was amazing ."
because the quality of menu items is very poor .
the service was fabulous !
the dj was great and kept everyone dancing .
i did n't want anything free .
steaks were perfectly cooked and very tender .
they came out twice within a month to fix our pool .
"to the venues credit , it wasnt terrible looking ."
again still had empty waters and did n't ask if we needed anything else .
the family atmosphere is great and you can tell they really value their customers .
the service was good .
"horrible customer service , quality of food is comparable to del taco ."
my cut is outstanding .
it 's just one of those places everyone should try !
that 's ridiculous !
product selection is alright too .
their specialty pizzas are delicious .
it was horrible and i returned them both .
"however , i doubt very seriously that it is ."
there 's about three stores that have these same clothes and this is one .
everything i have ever tried here is delicious !
it has delicious eggs and pancakes .
"it was big , juicy , brought half home ."
so i left a message for daniel ford ( the owner ? )
our server pedro was excellent with a cute smile .
the side of cornbread was also forgettable .
it was great .

i been patronizing this location for years and finally feel compelled to compliment them .
when we returned the raw eggs the chef returned the eggs over hard .

later i realize the food he was giving them was my food .

the four women were absolutely wonderful .
i was very frustrated with our visit for an early dinner .
i was unable to get my exam completed because of that .

"we thought he was joking , he was n't ."
they did n't have any flavor .

it 's a must for me to come here when i 'm in vegas .
the business owner is a good friend of ours .
i love this place .
best mariscos i have ever had in arizona .
this one has a gas station which is a nice convenience .
their prices are great .
the room was n't ready .
it 's not really worth making the trip from phoenix .
this place is the worst !
brie was expensive and the worst tasting i 've ever had .
the food is consistent and good .
it came with two cups of ranch !
the salad was large and fresh and wrap was good .
"the burgers were decent , but not spectacular ."
first off my husband and i went to dinner here on a thursday night .
that magical day has arrived .
do n't order to go unless you are n't hungry .
it was delicious .
there was one other customer and she got no smiles either .
their customer service was excellent .
it 's amazing how much of a difference it makes in the bathroom .
but we stayed _num_ days and it was okay .
they do good dim sum and good chinese main dishes .
i can not comment on the main courses as we did not have any .
great pizza and wings and the bar has great drink specials .
the food is great and pairs well with the extensive wine list .
for my second drink i asked for less lemon and that did n't happen .
the food was excellent .
sad to say i do n't recommend their delivery method .
me and my wife came and forgot to make a reservation .
thought it was kind of odd to serve rice with pad thai but whatever .
"the bakery items are very good , the coffee is bad ."
you will be glad you did !
it gave me the runs and i will never go back !
they lost my business for good .

my wait time is minimal and the staff is friendly and very helpful .
this place is just amazing .
the chicken burrito is my favorite !
what i am writing about is how i was treated recently .
"btw it was yummy , excellent sauces ."
our server asked the manager twice to adjust our ticket and she ignored it .
overall this place was n't too terrible but it def was n't nice .
i swear to god they must mess with people for fun here .
it tastes like they took egg drop soup and made it spicy .
almost every time i have been let down .
rula bula is a `` must visit '' for the mill avenue visitor .

the staff is exceptional and welcoming .
it tasted great ; just like i expected .
adam helped me out a ton .

but the food was n't up to par .
"fun , noisy atmosphere , and the best onion rings i 've ever had ."
i love this shopping area .
"it was slightly sweet , super creamy and not bitter at all ."
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
i dont have any patience to use that crap .
they seriously take my time into consideration .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
also the food there isnt the greatest .
the dr. pepper was flat .
it was absolutely perfect .
our server was very good also .
yummy sushi has some of the best sushi in town .

this hotel is amazing .
"very friendly , very fast and he knows what he is doing ."
"then our check came , he overcharged us ."

food is always top notch !

the sushi was bland with a lot of rice .
one of the best pizza i have ever had .
i do n't know about this place .
the only flavor mine had was from the $ _num_ worth of peppers .
this is now my favorite vietnamese restaurant in town !
they can accommodate large groups and are willing to make special orders .
we just received the car which was in perfect condition .
i gave two stars only because the items were hot when i receive them .
do not order from home depot because they use this company .
"fried rice is always a favorite , along with dumplings !"
i quickly advised the associate this was totally unacceptable and bring a manager immediately .
"honestly , it 's pretty unassuming from the outside ."
"not to mention , ned is a really cool happy guy ."
jewel and her staff are the best !
thank you joseph !
they are rude and uncaring .
seats were old & busted .
the rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful .
i love this place .
he returned with a blended margarita with no salt .

i definitely recommend this place !
they are artists of the highest caliber and really listen to the customer .

"for me , it 's these guys ."
we all put our items back and walked out .
portion size is beyond generous -- typically at least two meals .
i had pad thai and crab puffs ... both amazing .
the service is terrible .

this place is pretty legit .
none of the regulars were there .
it looked like a ghost town .

the carnitas burrito is the best ... yummy good .
the crazy decor is always fun at any of the rainforest locations .
simply the best i have had .
would i stay here again if i had too ?
i have to say they are the best .
i love supporting this business .
i love that it 's not a chain and has its own unique feel .
"plus , the dealer named wolfgang was very rude to us as well ."
what was worse was that the teller seemed annoyed with me .

my friends meal looked very lackluster .
we stayed here for four nights in a two bedroom suite .
yes the area is urban but the food is worth the value .
customer service was horrible .
my usual chinese spot was closed so we ventured here .
they do offer umbrellas as well if needed to protect you from the heat .
the best part was they only changed a minimal fee for the service .
"if anyone knows of other spots , please let me know ."
servers were nice young ladies .
share the dishes - they are huge .
and it 's a good a new .
at one meal we ordered the entire appetizer menu .
pizza is good and you ca n't beat the beer selection .
he was horrible with the brakes .
throw in an excellent bakery and you have a winner .
the food is mediocre and i 'd rather eat taco bell for the price .
the pizza that was delivered were prepared horribly !
it 's just a weird and annoying feature of eating out .
everything always seems to be completed in a timely manner .
they had my car three days and could n't find it .
all the wonderful ladies work hard to make everyone smile .
"the burger is very good too , very moist !"
my gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a sat .
the room they provided was spectacular .
"to top that off , all the fuss about their tortillas is true ."
this is my go-to spot for lunch .
until this changes this city will still be stuck in the 80s .
aloha vs buffet @ asia which is just minutes up the street .
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
lab next door closed down so now _num_ tech runs a humble lab onsite .

our waitress was pushy and a bit rude .
all of the staff are wonderful .

they have the best breakfast !
i 'm sure no one cared .
i love the library .
the customer service i receive is amazing .
"poor customer service would actually work out , we got no customer service ."
"and holy hell , they do not know what a sense of urgency is !"
it 's a good standby for late night eats .
so you have a $ _num_ for $ _num_ deal at yelp .

it can get a little crowded but it is worth the wait .
"consistently , they are terrible at this one particular starbucks ."
"instead of wasting anymore time arguing , i asked for a refund and left ."

my chicken wings were cold .
"i spent thousands of dollars on his meds , blood tests and monthly visits ."
her office staff is very nice and friendly .
prices are also very reasonable .
a very small place and the food is always good & fresh .

if you order this it 's best to eat it there .
i had the super sicilian and it was excellent .
they are absolutely delicious .
prices are reasonable and portions are generous .

even the roast beef is n't as good anymore .
i definitely recommend this place .

service is amazing : ) very happy and welcoming .
i love how each dish comes with complementary sopapillas - sooo good !
it 's almost like they do n't give a crap about the restaurant tables .
the best thing on the menu is the hot italian sub !
but most of the time this place just falls flat .
she put in a glass of cabernet and burger sliders which we never ordered .
well my reuben had barely had any meat and no _num_ island dressing .
they are god 's gift to breakfast .
for a quick meal this is about as good as it gets .
even some of the cashiers at this location look a little sketchy .
tonight we went and it was the final straw .
the food here is delicious .
the best items on the menu are the fajitas and the fajita fundido burrito .
"after taxes and everything , i ended up paying $ _num_ ."

the filet mignon is so tender and flavorful .
the cappuccino tasted like a cheap water and powder mix .
they would n't do a full refund as we ate some of the pizza .
best part of our meal was that i felt great after .
"they are helpful , and have a lot of clearance sections ."
"i ended driving a mile away to ulta however , they were closing ."
best mexican food i 've found in this town so far .
"drove by and found this place , so i decided to stop in ."
it has been a frustrating experience to say the least .
"not here , it was made fresh to order ."
the place was very crowded but server was friendly .
they are a perfect match to pair with the cheesesteak sub .
keeping this place open is well worth that cost .

this is always our 2nd choice target .
everything here is sooo good .

"wine glass was dirty , but service was superb ."
i love looking through their shoes though .
my orders are always right on take out and that means a lot .

everything was great !
"they do a great job , especially adam ."

we were terribly disappointed .

this woman is so professional and well trained .
i came back and they took care of it without any hassle !

my bridesmaids and friends were opening champagne and pouring drinks for our guests .
staff was very friendly and easy going .
i ended up here by accident ( not a happy accident ) .
"on top of that , more procedures were added that were never discussed ."
"he ordered a chicken , but he left _num_ % of them ."
she went back over there and asked if she could search the shuttle .
the pumpkin porter is amazing !
she is the only one id trust .
it was easily one of the best i 've had at an einstein 's !
"our server was genuine , sweet and made sure we were taken care of ."
and i loved seeing all the beers on ice at the counter .
this place is so good !
went back for a visit last night and boy were we disappointed !
"this place does decent thai food , but is nothing special ."
i thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question .
so i ordered a _num_ piece chicken meal with _num_ sides .
staff are friendly .
oh wow i was so pleased with my online order .
this is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down .
front desk service was terrible .
one star is far more than they deserve .
if you love prime rib this is the place to be .
and it fits my budget perfectly .
"the beer , food , atmosphere , and service is always top notch ."
were delicious .
the phenomenal service of the staff was only surpassed by the phenomenal food .
the service was great but the food was barely adequate .
"they look like they wish they could be anywhere else , other than there ."
this place is a gem .
now that 's service !
also getting money back is really a problem .
price quoted was the price charged .
he was completely rude to me the whole night .
i 'm glad i know a good place for a sandwich now !
"wow , was i pleasantly surprised at this little place ."
i was thinking to myself after the experience why i even waited that long .
this is a family favorite since its nearby and quick .
so it 's best to call in your order a head of time .
now my glasses look terrible .
the guys are great .
i went to the papa johns off n jones and they were fantastic .
i love her massages .
there was no hot water .
our actual food was n't any better .
i 'm new to photography and david was patient explaining new items to me .
no one cleaned our room .
no way it was going to work for me .
"i always enjoy their fajitas , queso and margaritas ."
the burgers were good .
this is one of my favorite places to go in phoenix !
the food and service as awesome as the last time i was here .
thank you !
"but this ai n't no relative rating , and phoenix needs some better bbq ."
you wait hours to pick them up .
"needless to say , i eventually gave up ."
i have also had amazing facials here with nicole .
it was overcooked by almost double .
the chandeliers and ceilings were gorgeous and the service we got was great .
they are always friendly to our group when we show up for lunch .
has great beer prices and pizza wing combos .
did i leave at this point ?
hoping to save this terrible lunch trip we still ordered them .
the only good part of the meal was the hostess .
they also have a pretty solid free breakfast bar .
"the place is clean , decorated nicely , and comfortable ."
weiss surpassed my expectations !
the food was fresh and the prices super reasonable .
well i hated it .
unfortunately phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots .
there are a lot of tastier and friendlier options for mexican food in madison .
"bartender , dean , was excellent ."
"not best i 've ever had , but pretty good ."
there were only a handful of girls there and really only two attractive ones .
this is so beyond unacceptable .
they did an excellent job on my laptop !
the sushi is fresh and amazing .
we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
my nephew had a very very poor experience in replacing his screen .
"sorry for the rant , but man , the place is terrible ."
an honest family owned business that is true to their word .
"all of the nurses are friendly , caring , and very attentive ."
staff was extremely friendly and polite .
they are already closed .
they have the best refried beans .
the poor quality of the food makes it overpriced .
i 've always loved southwest airlines since i was a little girl .
this place has a vintage phoenix mexican restaurant vibe ... .
everyone in our party loved what they ordered to eat .
their tacos and southwest salad are yummy !
"i was n't bad per se , but i 've had waaaay better pho ."
there is literally something for everyone .
"this is a play land , not a picnic land '' ."
the customer service is terrible .
both of them were good and very fresh .
this was a huge disappointment !
the batter was crispy and the squash was soggy on the inside .
"i had the salmon , , so good ."
"`` it 's ok , if you ca n't afford a cadillac . ''"
the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .
a few minutes later or drinks were delivered and orders taken .
i 've never had a bad experience at this location until now .
"yep , a doctors office that gets four stars ."
i love the food and it is usually excellent service .
"she stated this multiple times , and scared the crap out of me ."
i took it into a repair shop and spent over _num_ dollars in repairs .
but ambiance was not the low spot .
the food and service at this location are exceptional .
i highly recommend the golden steer .
we had more than our fill and we will definitely go back !
very happy with how they handled this and will use them again .
i gave her the damn receipt & walked away .
their phone system is terrible .
this was a nightmare of a stay .
great family owned market !
everything else with seafood or meat was around the $ _num_ range or more .
the wife and i were trying to find good mexican food in vegas .
"tickets are inexpensive , and its always an exciting game !"
rather than die a painful death i decided to stop eating there .
i love the good egg .
the beef was tender and well seasoned .
was not bleeding too much .
"i , instead , went for the french onion soup and cesar salad ."
"my kids love it , too , which is a huge bonus ."
thank you !
fajita salad is amazing !
i love this place for their selection of past & present independent films .
for bar food this place is darn good !
made a call and they delivered a new one with very few questions .
they both tasted fresh .
brenda was amazing !
this place sucks .
i love this store .
"since you wont find parking , it is all so worth it ."
"also , the tissue box was disgusting ."
staff treat you like family !
pho kim long ... we go way back homes .
this is a piece of crap property .
i was in awe the whole time !
she did not want me to order this in a seafood restaurant .
it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .
"cool atmosphere , open really late , and seems pretty authentic ."
that 's why respect .
that 's the only way the fish could have been so overcooked .
_num_ salespeople saw us but never gave us the time of day .
wish i could give negative stars .
"salad is bomb , sides are amazing , meat is fresh , fast service ."
i was so annoyed .
"that 's not something you get everywhere , so definitely a plus there !"
the people working were incredibly nice and helpful people .
the grounds and site is well kept and relaxing .
"pain in the ass , they are closed for _num_ weeks ."
i visited on a saturday afternoon for brunch and had a great time !
"dr carr office and his staff are amazing , professional and caring people ."
it goes to the _num_ number .
a week later i had to give the phoenix location another chance .
these are the best combination you can get in a lenny 's burger .
the staff is friendly and they are very personable .
"a while later , the waitress refilled our drinks ."
"the texture was lovely , it was n't dry and the serving was huge !"
"the salsa was tasty , but i would hardly add a star to it ."
the shredded beef was amazing .
no other information was given .
"i have purchased two cars from chapman , each with a negative experience ."
this is a small bakery that has great breads and pastries .
plus i know that the owners love all the animals !
"okay , the food is not the best mexican food in the world ."
it was one of the most frustrating calls ive made in a long time .
the salsa bar was also on point and i will definitely be returning !
i love this place .
"in any case , they 're both worth a visit ."
so i really enjoy this pet store .
they always have cars too and good choices .
not hey i have taken care of your issue .
all of it was amazing .
"very loud and noisy , but the food is great ."
"i ordered the thai cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique , healthy flavor !"
"totally average experience , the only saving grace was the soup ."
it 's nuts and fairly priced .
our upstairs neighbors are horribly rude .
table service was lacking .
the staff is amazing .
"i even went a few times , thinking the next time would be better ."
"wrote a detailed complaint to their management , still waiting for a response ."
each of the six entrees were lukewarm .
this place has a great presentation .
i loved coming here every few days to shop .
i just had the wings again at this place .
it 's four floors of m & m merchandise .
it still cost close to $ _num_ for a miserable dinner .
this is awesome !
all courses came in a timely manner .
"the spiced potatoes are amazing , and the crab rangoons are really good too ."
never had such a bad experience with vegas hotels until today .
but it was nothing special .
they give me _num_ coffee .
it was _num_ at that point .
service is quick and timely and the employees are super friendly .
quick service and owner is really nice .
worst customer service i have ever had .
"and it 's worth the wait , anyways !"
i did n't even try it .
it was just bad all around .
"we enjoyed kung pao , fried rice , lemon chicken amd egg drop soup !"
the food sucked and my server kelly was not very nice .
"terminal e is a trek , but the eating selection is great ."
customer service sucks .
"for the entree , i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti ."
these folks really care .
under her breath and walked away .
the comforter looked _num_ years old and had holes !
he acted as if this there was really no reason to be concerned .
i ordered pasta with meat sauce .
tables were pretty small too .
"having read the reviews , i knew to stay away from the brisket ."
be prepared to wait but it 's worth it .
the sushi rice tasted very sour like it was a few days old .
they hate working on friday and saturday nights obviously .
"fresh cut potatoes , crispy fried , cooked to perfection and served piled high !"
the food is delicious !
i got a great deal on replacement tires .
the pizza was gross .
failed attempt at good cuisine .
the guy who helped was real good at finding what we needed .
lawry 's the prime rib does well with both .
"rustic theme would be ok , if i thought it was clean ."
it 's right down the street from my office .
this place rocks with tasty food .
they also did not feed my dog two of her meals .
shocked by how delicious their sushi was .
they also have great salad and pizza options too !
it 's annoying .
this is the place for you .
they frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there .
"particularly , i am impressed with their produce , fresh fish and staff !"
"oh , and the service has always been good here ."
"other than them , the bar was completely empty ."
good size servings to .
"this is a well managed , clean restaurant ."
great prices for what they have .
i do n't even know where to start !
summer camp is fabulous as well .
avoid until they get over themselves .
that sign seems very unfriendly and unwelcoming .
she ends up ringing me up for that _num_ instead .
baker 's is so close and so charming !
the cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor .
southwest customer service or customer experience is a fail .
it 's a fabulous resource for children and families .
she was dead .
"as long as this continues , we will always come back !"
he wrote the prescription and walked out .
"i am extremely disappointed , and do not recommend this school ."
my boyfriend hated his food so much that he did n't finish .
all the workers walking around are so friendly and nice and helpful .
"for $ _num_ each , i was not too pleased ."
bread was pretty good also .
and it was really clean !
habib is the biggest sweetheart !
the food sucked ass .
because you seem to be upsetting a lot of people in this town .
because it becomes a war zone here very quickly .
she 's nice and knows how to care for there clients .
the food is always good .
i also go to the mimi 's in chandler ... just as good .
it has a peppery spread with the pepperoni on the inside .
first time here and absolutely love it !
"in short , the move was a success ."
justin is amazing .
our room on the 16th floor has a beautiful view of the stratosphere .
felt good about the visit .
she did n't want to give it to me .
i felt satisfied with my experience today .
unfortunate because they are a neighborhood service dealer .
"thank you for your excellent service , matt ."
it ai n't worth it .
"from the service to the sangria to the tapas , firefly does it right ."
this place is a hell hole .
get to this great restaurant before it closes !
it was the best choice i could have made .
"the place is small , yet very elegant and everything is done right ."
it did n't seem bad enough to go to the er .
they also have great lunch specials .
however that does n't make up for the substandard steaks .
that was all he was willing to take off .
management needs to come across a little more sincere too with their apologies .
service always good and the pizza is awesome .
wife and i checked in tonight for a sunday .
i just do n't get it .
the shrimp cocktail tasted stale as if it sat in the fridge all day .
it lacked flavor and just simply was n't tasty .
i find it incredibly hard to believe that this place has such glowing reviews .
overall it was a fantastic experience .
this is a pretty cool little store .
i rated this meal five stars because of the lobster bisque .
"we ordered some roasted brussel sprouts , classic pizza , fries , and hummus ."
pets are welcomed too !
this place is good .
i had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies .
service was great ... and all the food including desserts were fresh and home-made !
i am not going to eat there again .
"i appreciate that their burgers are as special , juicy and flavorful as always ."
"also , the decor of the restaurant just screamed tired , old , diner ."
"there were only _num_ tables with patrons , so i think she was managing ."
i had a wonderful stay here .
if you are looking for thai food i strongly recommend the green mango instead .
everything was good and service was fast .
i 'm convinced she just wanted to leave early .
complimentary breakfast and happy hour were awesome !
the food is awesome .
food is fantastic .
when the food finally did come it was cold .
so very disappointing that no one other than my server checked on me .
the outdoor balcony seating offers a nice view of the main strip .
what was also incredible was the service .
i especially liked trevor .
all of the salon locations are beautiful .
i love the pico type salsa with warm chips nice touch !
"people who check you in are not friendly , at all ."
she then ended up throwing up her entire dinner in the toilet .
our room had _num_ double beds .
purchase doors here but do not let them do the installation .
this airport is garbage on so many levels .
"needless to say , i walked out ."
staff were not as attentive as other restaurants .
it was awesome !
they are either incompetent or straight up liars .
ambience was very good.
"the service is ok , if a little slow to start ."
i love their food .
i 'm so glad a friend told me about it !
i do like to get ryan as well but honestly they are all good .
"one star , zero if there was a zero rating !"
it 's a great experience though pretty expensive for m & ms .
our guide was super funny and friendly !
the bleu cheese wedge salad was delicious .
the absolute worst part was the lack of sanitation .
the wings were incredible with terrific flavor and the pizza was also fantastic !
this is a good place to go for breakfast or lunch .
yet she treats me like scum .
"the service was quick , friendly , and the food was amazing ."
i love love love the gyro here .

taste buds never felt so good !
she had a bad attitude from the minute we stepped up to be helped .
"i am a huge fan of their lo mein , it is fantastic ."
the first time i went to mario 's it was dismal .
it literally came with burnt chorizo and peppers on top .
they gave us a good chunk of fish which had a nice smoky flavor .
i think everyone who works at this location is so friendly .
he got chicken and steak and said it was very good .
barber was a total ass .

"he has a very professional manner , dresses very professional ."
the hostess was the worst .

they are very accommodating and my son always has a good time .

this is a store with great integrity .
everything i 've eaten has been great .
"i love this place , been shopping here for years ."
"we used to live nearby , and came here regularly for karaoke ."
quite possibly the best corned beef i 've ever had !
we have been coming here for a couple of years and love this place !
"i mean really , what can you do to spaghetti ."
certainly the best church food i 've ever had = ) .
too bad i could not convince him how good the food is .
all the tapas are great and the sangria makes is good as well .
"but , both sets of screens were made too large to fit the windows ."
it was more like a pizza flavored quesadilla than an actual pizza .
i see why this place is hurting for business .
i am totally shocked that people like this restaurant .
the ambiance is also very unique set in an old church .
"overall , i was very impressed ."
the owner and staff are incredibly nice and fun .
the side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning .
yesterday i got my first tattoo with ed .
best green chicken enchiladas i 've ever had in my life !
this is by far one of my favorite places to go in charlotte .
"never use this company , they are horrible ."
again i travel for a living and bartenders like that our award winners !
the pancakes had no taste .
"this place is awesome , new cameras and new management ."
the bar is also not far away as well .
we did the tour through the factory and it was nothing special .

were they going to wait for the worst to happen !
everything else are good as well .

this place is the worst .
i can not stand the way people do business these days .
this place is fantastic !
did a short tour of this fun park .
the more i spend the more you charge to deliver ?
worse than when we had arrived .
it is really that good .
`` express lane '' is a complete joke .
that is not my concern .
not to mention it was so bland .
"discount is the key word , but without the really low prices ."
they overcharged me for my food .
they are standing around talking in groups instead of greeting customers .
i have eaten here several times now and the food is really tasty .
we stumbled across this gem while we were next door at the wine bar .
i get compliments from friends and family .
this place is amazing !
i 've had children at this school since it opened in _num_ .

erica is _num_ % right !
i know a little something about cars .
the guy cooking did not even acknowledge me .
the mad rush to find seats is both inefficient and annoying .
and because they are so bad they are way over priced .
they always have a full house .

happy hour prices are the best in town !
i really love the italian classic and the french dip .

she is a doll and really an expert at her trade .
which is sad when it 's suppose to compliment the steak .
we would recommend splitting a plate but they will charge extra if you do .

i was impressed with his work .
daniel was great .
she then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her .

tonight was a different story .
$ _num_ for a soda from the vending machine is an insult .

was here with friends some months ago .
service was slow and spotty .
it was like taking a bite of flavorless breading and hardly any shrimp .
i bought pastries at this place several times before .
they have delicious food and great lunch special prices .
we simply loved it .
quality and quantity is given here .
each dessert is just sweet enough .
all we wanted to do was ship a package from phoenix to chicago .
"brandy was super attentive , knowledgable , kind and pleasant !"
the milkshakes are awesome and so is the delicious desserts they have up front .
this is just a very modern church and service .
"first of all , the customer service was great !"
it did n't have a fitted sheet .
i finally ventured past the delicious burgers and tried the elaine 's salad .
korean chicken was also very good .
they took all the edge off and made it a flat surface .
in all honesty i would 've rather had five guys or in-n-out burgers .
it is a very stylish upscale but not pricey place .
did a great job .
i like this place and am here most friday evenings with my wife .
we will definitely return next time we are in pittsburgh !
its a tad bit pricy but it 's worth it !
i have taken my dog here for extended boarding twice .

our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal .
"of course he told me no , because they had never been submitted ."
moo shu shrimp was fantastic !
so i really needed a fill and color today .
you know something 's wrong when your hairdresser says `` oops . ''
they even rolled out a couple of extra tables and chairs for us .
i always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work .
they also made the mistake of putting canned mushrooms in the mix .
shrimp tacos were ... nothing special .
first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
i was hoping it was a one time thing .
the food is definitely homemade and tasty .
i always feel that i 'm in good hands when working with al smith .
everything was so delicious .
if i give negative stars i would .
the other shops in this shopping area are great too .

craig managing the bar is godsend for the avenue .
management is clearly at fault .
great blueberry syrup with blueberries on top .
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .
a lack of concern for their service is obvious .
if there was a location closer i would go there instead !
by this time we had been ready to order food for over _num_ minutes .
"would recommend anyone to him that is looking for good quality , gorgeous flowers !"
first and foremost if your store is n't clean it will deter customers .
our last visit however was pretty disappointing .
hubby and i love this place .
the staff is nice and they know what they 're doing .
whenever i 'm in town i always bring the family through here .
these apartments are quiet and well kept .
it is a good family outing .
the fish is fresh on the weekend and the menu has something for everyone .
april the massage therapist is amazing !
did they lose my order and not tell me ?
"it 's up the street , we eat here all the time ."
it 's a little expensive but it 's well worth it .
the servers in the bar area are awesome !
everything made fresh in-house .
"we left cash to cover the drinks , no tip ."
"was told to come back in _num_ minutes , came back in _num_ minutes ."
wow was all i could say .
so it looks and smells like amazing coffee and tea .
"when the check comes , it 's _num_ % gratuity added automatically ."
there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one .
you could tell she did n't like those things either .
the staff is wonderfully friendly .
great if someone else is paying for your room .
this place is delicious .

we recently upgraded our sprint phones and added a line .
i have never had an issue with service or purchase .
"food was ok , nothing italian about it ( odd name choice ) ."
it 's just ridiculous .
the service was slow and understaffed .
the only somewhat good service were the dim sum cart ladies .
he asked me for id and a card .
neither was spicy at all .
i hate kfc and i would much sooner eat that than eat here again.
"the food was delicious , and the drinks were well made ."
definitely recommended - and our guests really liked the live music !
the taste was great .
it makes the wait for the food just fly by .
mel has sold me all three vehicles and is excellent .
"shrimp was cold , salmon was cold , fries were cold ."

i will dream about it until i get another one in my life .
they are total crooks .

the pie here was delicious !
i went for happy hour at the bar and had a good time .
place is also really clean .
the yellow tail sashimi was alright too .
the tellers are always friendly .
this place has some good island food with good portions .
probably the most unpleasant experience i 've ever had .
i expected my food to be freshly prepared ... all of it .
i just do n't see the appeal of the place .
i waited for a few more minutes and then walked out !
i gave the car hop $ _num_ and told him to keep the change .
"when we first got into the room , the lights would n't turn on ."
we walked away upset and he did nothing to stop us .
service is slow in the bar area .
the service is mediocre but i do enjoy the email updates they send .
( we were not playing too fast the group behind was right on us !

helped me get insurance in california after i had bought my car in vegas !
without the different dipping sauces the food tastes pretty plain .
everybody is very friendly and helpful .
they were terrific !
i 'm very pleased with the service i received .
the quesadilla was dripping grease .
"it 's my fault , i guess ."
will deliver here again if i have any more babies !
they are a waste of your time !
our server was fun and the manager was accommodating .
"other than that , they 're great ."

great venue and the staff is awesome .
they 've lost a customer .
"horrible service , we ended up having to go look for our check ."

today was really strange though .
probably the best chicken sandwich i have had in a long time !
went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
i vote anywhere else .
the french fries were soggy and over salty .
the property managers are never available to speak with .
"chicken was way over cooked and terrible , not worth the $ _num_ price ."
we highly recommend !
kung pao chicken nicely spiced .
this gem is located in the smith 's shopping center on boulder highway .

it 's not a fire or safety risk .
flavors complimented each other very nicely .

i do n't know if we will ever return to that outback again .
a very small portion that hardly is enough for a child .
the worst part have got to be the service .

i 've had two great experiences with rocky top in the past month .
"the women who work here , hate their lives ."

some co-workers brought me here for lunch and i enjoyed it very much .

my family and i love this place .
beds were uncomfortable and the shower was lousy .
price was appropriate .
thought that was a nice gesture .
walking traffic seems to flow well here !
"yes , there 's almost always a wait but it 's well worth it ."

really enjoyed our valentine 's day date here !
barely made it to gate ... plane was boarding when we got there !
it 's great !
it was very juicy and flavorful !
was highly recommended by the girl working the front desk at our hotel .
seems like they have too much business and are way too busy .
be prepared to stay for hours no matter what they tell you .
if i was n't so tired i would of headed someplace else !
i love the new look !
this woman was totally disorganized and a liar .
he is a true neighborhood treasure .
their supposedly best hot wings are n't even close to being the best .
midas is under new ownership and they are so professional .
the wings and stromboli are the best on the planet !
i got a credit on my account for referring a friend .
service is just as amazing .
let 's just say i was there for more than _num_ hours .
the worst thing was the service in the cafe .
it was top notch .

stuffed french toast : _num_ yr old loved it .
my favorite are the produce sales .
the service is quick and pleasant and you receive a healthy portion .
i love this place .

considering how far it is ... save your gas and shop more locally .
the gravy was flavorless as well .
purchased the ultimate wash for _num_ .
"this is a great place to get healthy , organic foods !"
even the caesar salad was disappointing .
the ice cream was delicious .
the room was so small and so was everything else in the room .

always unleashed is the best boarding facility i have taken my dog to .
the food is great and the atmosphere is even better .

my wedding day i wanted to surprise my husband with a very unique cake .
"the sauce was sweet , hot and thick ."
_num_ ) they had very limited concessions .
it 's a shame .
everything was cooked to perfection and delicious .
my cousins wife 's drink was done sort of sangria with cranberry in it .
"as mentioned in other reviews , the vegas airport is my idea of hell ."
i was standing there and he totally ignored me .
i order an apple juice for my daughter and they 're all out .
"i will tell you , it is the rice ."
its a cute little restaurant and packed .
the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon .
he has been wonderful about giving thoughtful advice .
so me and some friend went to this i hop today .
i love jamba juice .
mccarran is by far one of my favorites .
i am only giving _num_ stars because i feel bad giving one star .
the menu is full of delicious southern entrees that make it difficult to choose .
this place gets my definite approval !
"long wait , but we lucked out and got seats at the bar ."
this is a one of a kind dive diner !
i was disappointed .
the food is fantastic .
nothing seems to stay there for long .
both were very good .
this place knows what 's up .
that 's not good when you 're ordering food .
", while the mac needed more cooking time ."
they burned it ... no flavor !
i love this place for a few reasons .
the manicotti was dry and flavorless .
i get there only to find out they have nothing ready .
their beer is nothing special .
"peeling wallpaper , chipped paint , etc ."
for some reason it just was not hitting the spot with me .
the service was the absolute worst ever .
the staff is very attentive and it 's always a good time .
the line was a little long but worth the wait !
the air conditioner is impossible to manage .
their potato spuds are a sinful delight of homemade potato chips .
i have been a customer for years and it 's a real shame .
"wings are slimy , small , not hot , kinda gross ."
kimberly is a doll !
the wait staff is very friendly & professional too .

the ambience of the place just feels dirty all around .
we were very disappointed with the new location .
i went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience .
i just wanted to give a shout out to one of their best employees !
fresh fruit and veggies looked better than any grocery store .
the brownie was a lil ' debbie .
i was very pleased with the selection here .
during our perfect weather months they have a cute patio that you can enjoy .

we need a zero star rating here !
unfortunately when the main course arrived i became quickly disappointed .
the dark chocolates are just sooooooo good in particular .

i have nothing but the best to say about them !
